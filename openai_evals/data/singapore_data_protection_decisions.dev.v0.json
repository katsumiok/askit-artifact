The central issue to this case, in \nso far as it is related to the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (\u201cPDPA\u201d), is \nwhether the Organisation had made reasonable security arrangements to protect \nthe personal data of the students and students\u2019 parents that it had in its \npossession and control at the material time. \nMaterial Facts \n2 \nOne of the many preschools under the Organisation\u2019s management is the \nSparkletots @ Kampong Chai Chee centre (the \u201cpreschool\u201d). In the course of \nthe year, the preschool would organise various school trips, sometimes with the \nparticipation of the parents. In preparation for these trips, the preschool would \ncollect the parents\u2019 personal data (including NRIC numbers) to allow for \nverification of the parents\u2019 identity on the day of the trip. \n3 \nThe present investigations arise from one such school trip. A few days \nbefore the trip was scheduled to take place, a teacher at the preschool sent a \nphotograph of a consolidated attendance list to a \u201cWhatsApp\u201d chat group, \nreminding parents of the upcoming school trip. The attendance list contained \npersonal data relating to the 15 students in that particular class and their parents, \nand included the contact numbers and NRIC numbers of five of the parents (the \n\u201cPersonal Data\u201d). The \u201cWhatsApp\u201d chat group comprised of the parents of \nstudents from that class. \n4 \nThe teacher who sent the photograph of the attendance list quickly \ndeleted it after being alerted to the disclosure of personal data by one of the \nparents within the group chat. That same parent later lodged a complaint with \nthe Personal Data Protection Commission (\u201cPDPC\u201d). The PDPC thereafter \ncommenced investigations into the incident. \nConclusion  \n14 \nHaving found the Organisation to be in breach of section 24 of the \nPDPA, I am empowered under Section 29 of the PDPA to give the Organisation \nsuch directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. \n15 \nIn determining the appropriate directions to be imposed on The \nOrganisation, I have taken into account the following mitigating factors:  \n(a) \nThe teacher in question acted swiftly in removing the Personal \nData from the \u201cWhatsApp\u201d group; and \n(b) \nThe number of individuals impacted by the disclosure (15 \nstudents and 30 parents) was relatively small and the disclosure was \nconstrained to the group of parents to whom the Personal Data pertained \nto. \n16 \nTo its credit, the Organisation also acted swiftly to address their \ninadequate policies \u2013 a response which, in my assessment, carries mitigating \nvalue. The following remedial actions taken by the Organisation have therefore \nbeen taken into account: \n(a) \nImmediate suspension of all \u201cWhatsApp\u201d chat groups following \nthe disclosure;  \n(b) \nExpedited the implementation of a set of \u201cSocial Media Policy / \nWhatsapp chat group rules\u201d that was already under development when \nthe breach occurred; \n(c) \nRolled out a suite of other policies across the Organisation \nincluding a \u201cDocument Retention Policy\u201d and an \u201cInformation Security \nPolicy\u201d; and \n(d) \nUndertook the development of a practical employee handbook \nand conducted refresher training for its employees. \n17 \nHaving considered all the relevant factors of the case, I am of the view \nthat these remedial actions have sufficiently addressed the current gap in \npolicies and practices relating to the handling of personal data by the \nOrganisation\u2019s employees. I have therefore decided to issue a warning to the \nOrganisation for breaching its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA, \nwithout further directions or imposing a financial penalty. \n     \nYEONG ZEE KIN \nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER \nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nQuery: What is the Commission\u2019s approach to cases involving effects on children or minors?"}], "output": "t.union(t.literal('None'), t.list(t.int))"}, "ideal": "10", "checked": false}
