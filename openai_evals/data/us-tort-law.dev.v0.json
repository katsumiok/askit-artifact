State law permits purchasers of such memberships to cancel at any time, subject to a penalty imposed by the seller of up to 10% of the membership price. A former manager of the fitness center, who knew about the state law limitations, recently opened a new gym nearby. To attract customers, the former manager sent flyers to local residents stating that anyone who had already purchased a long-term gym membership had \"the right to cancel that membership at any time, for any reason, without penalty.\" The flyer also provided a $50 discount on a long-term membership at the new gym to anyone who canceled an existing membership elsewhere. After the promotion began, several members of the prominent fitness center canceled their memberships and joined the new gym. When the prominent fitness center withheld penalties from the refund amounts, the members objected and threatened to report the matter to the state consumer protection agency. The prominent fitness center has sued the former manager for tortious interference with contract. The former manager has moved for summary judgment, based on the facts mentioned. Should the court grant the motion?\nA. Yes, because the former manager was simply competing with the prominent fitness center.\nB.
