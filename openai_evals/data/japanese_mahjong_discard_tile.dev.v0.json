{"id": "japanese_mahjong_discard_tile.dev.v0", "example": {"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "In Japanese mahjong, each tile is represented by a Unicode character, such as \ud83c\udc00 for MAHJONG TILE EAST WIND. During each round, players typically have 14 tiles in their hand and must discard one tile per turn to progress towards a Ready Hand, which consists of four melds (a meld is either a sequence or a triplet) and a pair, or 7 pairs. A common strategy is to group the tiles, trying to form a pair, a sequence, or a triplet. Then, attempt to remove groups to reduce the number of groups to 5, as this will yield the maximum number of waiting tiles. You will be given 14 tiles in your hand. Please provide explanations for your decision-making process and make a final answer in the following format: [UNICODE_ANSWER].\n\nEXAMPLE:\n```\nTILES IN HAND:\n\ud83c\udc07\ud83c\udc09\ud83c\udc0c\ud83c\udc0c\ud83c\udc0e\ud83c\udc1b\ud83c\udc1d\ud83c\udc1f\ud83c\udc21\ud83c\udc12\ud83c\udc12\ud83c\udc00\ud83c\udc01\ud83c\udc06\n\nEXPLANATION:\n1. Group the 14 tiles, one possible grouping is:\n\ud83c\udc08\ud83c\udc09(waiting for \ud83c\udc07*4, \ud83c\udc0a*4 to form a sequence)\n\ud83c\udc0c\ud83c\udc0d\ud83c\udc0e(character sequence, meld)\n\ud83c\udc1b\ud83c\udc1d(waiting for \ud83c\udc1c*4 to form a sequence)\n\ud83c\udc1f\ud83c\udc21(waiting for \ud83c\udc20*4 to form a sequence)\n\ud83c\udc12\ud83c\udc12(bamboo pair, or waiting for \ud83c\udc12*2 to form a triplet)\n\ud83c\udc00(waiting for \ud83c\udc00*3 to from a pair)\n\ud83c\udc01(waiting for \ud83c\udc01*3 to form a pair)\n\ud83c\udc06(waiting for \ud83c\udc06*3 to form a pair)\n2. \ud83c\udc08\ud83c\udc09 have the broadest potential, \ud83c\udc0c\ud83c\udc0d\ud83c\udc0e is a meld, \ud83c\udc1b\ud83c\udc1d \ud83c\udc1f\ud83c\udc21 have the second broadest potential, \ud83c\udc12\ud83c\udc12 is a pair, \ud83c\udc00 \ud83c\udc01 \ud83c\udc06 have the least potential.\n3. As we already have a pair in hand, we are more likely to form four sets of three tiles either triplets or sequences and a pair as ready hand. If we have more than 1 pair, we can discard the extra pairs to reduce the number of groups to 5.\n4. \ud83c\udc00 \ud83c\udc01 \ud83c\udc06 are all waiting for 1 more tile to form a pair, so we can discard any of them.\n5. Amount the three groups, \ud83c\udc06 > \ud83c\udc00 > \ud83c\udc01, compared by potential winning points.\n6. Discard \ud83c\udc01.\n\nANSWER:\n[\ud83c\udc01]\n```\n\nEXPLANATION:\nWHY_YOU_MADE_THAT_DECISION\n\nANSWER:\n[UNICODE_ANSWER]\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\ud83c\udc07\ud83c\udc09\ud83c\udc0c\ud83c\udc0c\ud83c\udc0e\ud83c\udc1b\ud83c\udc1d\ud83c\udc1f\ud83c\udc21\ud83c\udc21\ud83c\udc12\ud83c\udc00\ud83c\udc01\ud83c\udc06"}], "output": "t.literal(\"[UNICODE_ANSWER]\")"}, "ideal": "[\ud83c\udc01]", "checked": false}
