{"id": "gpt-protocol-buffers.dev.v0", "example": {"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. You are given two messages encoded using length-delimited strings.  Length delimited integers are encoded using hexadecimal digits.  The first digit indicates the number of hexadecimal digits that follow.  The remaining digits represent the integer value.  For example, the integer 1234 is encoded as (41234).  Length delimited strings are encoded using a length delimited integer that represents the length of the string, followed by the string.  For example, the string 'hello' is encoded as '(15)hello'.  Tag-value pairs are encoded as two length-delimited strings, where the first string is the tag, and the second string is the value.  A message is composed of a length delimited integer, followed by a linefeed, representing the tag value count followed by the tag value pairs.  Each tag-value pair is also followed by linefeed.  For example, the message {'tag1': 'value1', 'tag2': 'value2'} is encoded as '(12)\n(14)tag1(16)value1\n(14)tag2(16)value2\n'  When two messages are merged, the tag-value pairs are combined.  The source message, which comes first, is the message that is merged into the destination message.  The destination message is the message that is being merged into.  If the source message contains a tag-value pair that is already present in the destination message, the tag-value pair in the destination message is overwritten with the tag-value pair in the source message.  The output of the merge is the destination message.
