Your job is to build a pyramid of numbers from the question, and use it to compute the word count of the desired answer.\nThe numbers in the pyramid, starting from the vertex, correspond to the words in the question. Each number is the character count of the corresponding word.\nIgnore the punctuation.\n\nFollow the steps:\nStep 1. List each word in the question, next to it print the character count.\nStep 2. Print a formatted pyramid by listing the character counts, top-down and from left to right. Fill the rest of the pyramid with zeros.\nStep 3. Show step-by-step at least one way to obtain the word count of the desired answer by adding and subtracting the rows, columns and diagonals of the pyramid.\n\nNote that in Step 3. you must use the least possible number of substeps. The max number of substeps is 7."}, {"role": "system", "content": "Question: Tell me clearly what is the main point.\nDesired answer: The misunderstood goal of one of the two trusted persons.", "name": "example_user"}, {"role": "system", "content": "Step 1.\n- tell (4)\n- me (2)\n- clearly (7)\n- what (4)\n- is (2)\n- the (3)\n- main (4)\n- point (5)\nStep 2:\n```\n4\n2 7\n4 2 3\n4 5 0 0\n```\nStep 3.\n- sum the diagonal 4+7+3+0=14\n- sum the diagonal 2+2+0=4\n- subtract 14-4=10", "name": "example_assistant"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Will I find true love in the near future?\nDesired answer: Love is on the horizon, stay open and take risks."}], "output": "t.dict({\"character_count\": t.int, \"formatted_pyramid\": t.list(t.list(t.int)), \"step_by_step\": t.list(t.union(t.literal(\"sum the diagonal\"), t.literal(\"sum the row\"), t.literal(\"sum the column\"), t.literal(\"subtract\"), t.literal(\"add\"))))"}, "ideal": null, "checked": false}
