{"id": "mazes-10x10.test.v2", "example": {"input": [{"role": "user", "content": "**Task Description:**\n<task_description>\nYou will be given a text-based 2D maze represented by numbers. The maze consists of pathways (0), walls (1), a starting point (2), and an exit (3).\nYour task is to determine the full solution (series of moves) to solve the maze, based on the following rules:\n- You can move up, down, left, or right to the immediate next cell in the chosen direction. The directions are always \nconsidered from a top-down view of the maze: regardless of your previous move 'up' moves to the cell above (True North), \n'down' to the cell below, 'left' to the cell on the left, and 'right' to the cell on the right.\n- Moves that lead to a wall (1) or outside the maze boundaries are not allowed.\n- The goal is to reach the exit (3) from the starting point (2) using the shortest possible legal path.\n- When considering potential moves, exclude directions that lead out of the maze boundaries or back to a previously visited location.\n</task_description-end>\n**Instructions:**\n<instructions>\n1. Write down the maze in its current form.\n2. Make some initial inferences based on the layout of the maze, the location of the starting point (2), the exit (3), and the walls (1).\n3. Identify possible moves from the start position (2) [up, down, left, right], eliminate those that lead to walls or outside the maze. Print the remaining options.\n4. Work through a logical chain of thought to propose a solution to the maze. This should involve identifying the \npossible moves from the current position and eliminating those that lead to walls or outside the maze.\n5. Critically evaluate your solution, identify any flaws in your decision-making, and adjust the solution if needed.\n6. Repeat steps 1 and 5 until you reach the exit (3). \n<instructions-end>\n\n<example>\nFor example, you may be given the following maze:\n<maze>\n[0,1,0]\n[0,1,0]\n[0,2,3] \n<maze-end>\n\n<solution-formating>\nThe final answer should be in exactly this format:\nSolution: [up,up,left]\n<solution-formating-end>\n\n<example-response>\n**Expected Response:**\n1) reprint the maze as it is given to us: [0,1,0]\n[0,1,0]\n[0,2,3] \n2) the exit appears to be directly to the right of the start position,\n3) the possible moves from the start position are: [right, left] because down goes out of bounds, and up runs into a wall.\n4) the solution is: [right] because left moves away from the exit (3) and right directly leads to the exit.\n5) the solution is correct, no flaws in decision making.\nSolution: [right]\n<example-response-end>\n\n<example-end>\n\nHere is your maze.
