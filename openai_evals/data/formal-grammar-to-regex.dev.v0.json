The formal grammar is represented as a series of production rules. Each letter is a symbol. Terminal symbols are represented by lowercase letters, 'S' is the start symbol, and 'e' symbolizes the empty string. Your generated regular expression should be formatted using Extended Regular Syntax (ERS), and must not include empty string symbol. Provide the regular expressions in their most straightforward form, without any superfluous clauses or symbols. Carefully reason to your answer. Upon concluding your analysis, end your response with the statement, \"Therefore, the regular expression which is equivalent to this grammar is `REGEX`.\" If deriving a regular expression isn't feasible, respond with \"Therefore, the grammar is not regular.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "A -> aB | e, B -> bA, S -> A | B"}], "output": "t.union(t.str, t.literal(\"Therefore, the grammar is not regular.\"))"}, "ideal": "Therefore, the regular expression which is equivalent to this grammar is `b?(ab)*`.", "checked": false}
