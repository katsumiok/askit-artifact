Generate a syntactically correct SingleStore query. \n Use the following tables and columns:\nTable: books. Columns:id INT PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR(100), author VARCHAR(255), publication_date DATE, description TEXT, description_vector BLOB\n\nQuestion: Are there any books that deal with the theme of 'self-discovery' like 'Eat, Pray, Love'?\n"}], "output": "t.str"}, "ideal": "SELECT DISTINCT title, DOT_PRODUCT(description_vector, JSON_ARRAY_PACK(embeddings('Eat, Pray, Love'))) as Score from books ORDER BY Score DESC;", "checked": false}
