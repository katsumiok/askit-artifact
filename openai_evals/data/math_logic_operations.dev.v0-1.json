Your final answer will be a number, which you will enclose in square brackets. For example, if your final answer is the number 5, you will report your answer as [5]. ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FOR THE QUESTION: You currently do math using the standard order of operations. I am going to redefine this order of operations, and introduce you to some new rules. From now on, execute addition (+) and subtraction (-) before multiplication (*) and division (/) (e.g. 5*4+2 would now be treated as 5*6=30, since you evaluate 4+2=6 first, and then multiply 5*6), and interpret any operations inside parentheses as the 'opposite' operation. Addition in parentheses should be interpreted as subtraction and multiplication in parentheses should be interpreted as division, and vice versa. Continue to compute operations inside parentheses before other operations. Using these rules, answer the following question (your answer should be in square brackets).
