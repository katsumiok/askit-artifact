The four beverages are (in no particular order): Coffee, sparkling water, Tea, and the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. Here is the little information you have to solve this riddle:\nArthur's favorite beverage is 'whatever' he can get from the vending machine in the Heart of Gold (either Tea or coffee) even if the bored computer crashes due to his request. Beeblebrox on the other hand prefers strong alcoholic cocktails. Marvin hates Tea even more than he hates his own consciousness and Trillion despises hot beverages altogether.\n\nEach of them has a different favorite drink out of the four. Can you figure out who likes which beverage?"}], "output": "t.dict({\"Arthur\": t.union(t.literal('Coffee'), t.literal('Tea')), \"Beeblebrox\": t.literal('Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster'), \"Marvin\": t.union(t.literal('Sparkling Water'), t.literal('Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster')), \"Trillian\": t.union(t.literal('Sparkling Water'), t.literal('Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster'))})"}, "ideal": "Beeblebrox's favorite drink is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, Trillion prefers sparkling water, Marvin's favorite drink is Coffee, and Arthur likes Tea.", "checked": false}
