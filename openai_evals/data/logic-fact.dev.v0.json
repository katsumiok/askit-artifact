If there is not enough information to solve the puzzle, conclude with 'There is not enough information.' There are five students, Anna, Bob and Cynthia, Dan and Eliza. They all tell the truth. Anna is taller than Cynthia. Bob says he's taller than Anna if and only if Eliza is the shortest. Cynthia is taller than Dan. Eliza is shorter than Dan. Who's the tallest in the group? Let's think step by step:"}], "output": "t.str"}, "ideal": "Anna > Cynthia > Dan > Eliza. But, based on Bob's statement, there are still two possibilities: 1. Bob is taller than Eliza, making Eliza the shortest, making Bob taller than Anna, making Bob the tallest. 2. Bob is shorter than Eliza: this would still be valid, as Eliza wouldn't be the shortest and therefore Bob isn't taller than Anna. And Anna would be the tallest. So there's not enough information", "checked": false}
