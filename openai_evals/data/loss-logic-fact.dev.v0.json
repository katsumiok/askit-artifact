The store sells the watermelon for $7. This would have been a $2 profit if the money received was real. The store receives $10 in counterfeit money. This money is worthless, so the store doesn't actually receive any value from the sale. The store gives the buyer $3 in change. This is a real loss, as the store loses $3 in real money. Now, let's calculate the net loss:  The store spent $5 to purchase the watermelon. The store lost $3 when giving the buyer change. So the net loss for the store is $5 (cost of watermelon) + $3 (change given) = $8.", "checked": false}
