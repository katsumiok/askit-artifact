The loan closed on April 17, 2007. At the time of the closing, Countrywide improperly failed to inform [the Cocrofts] of the real source of funding for their loan. Plaintiffs also contend that Countrywide violated TILA by failing to inform them that they had three days to rescind the loan and by failing to disclose the total sale price and itemize the amount financed, as well as by failing to make unspecified prepayment disclosures. The Cocrofts claim that Countrywide understated the total finance charges for the loan by more than $5,000. Plaintiffs claim that they learned of Countrywide's misrepresentations in June 2009. They decided to exercise their right under the provisions of TILA to rescind the loan. On July 1, 2009, they mailed notice to that effect to BA, the successor to Countrywide, and to MERS. The Cocrofts do not say what if anything happened as a result of those notices, but on September 29, lawyers working for HSBC contacted them and stated that HSBC was ready to begin foreclosure. HSBC claimed that it was the trustee of a trust that included their loan. The Cocrofts, however, contend that the transfer of their loan into the trust was defective. They sent HSBC's lawyers two cease and desist letters, notifying HSBC that they had rescinded the loan. They allege that after receiving one of the cease and desist letters, HSBC informed them that it had no interest in the loan and that they needed to contact the loan's servicer, Roundpoint Mortgage. Plaintiffs also sent a copy of the rescission documents to BAC, which they identify as the actual servicer of the loan. HSBC brought a foreclosure action in Illinois state court on January 19, 2010. [From below:] defendants unlawfully entered [the plaintiffs'] home by conducting a self-help eviction of the plaintiffs and changing the locks on their home in August 2008. At the time, [plaintiffs] had made arrangements to rent the property in the short term and then to sell it, and defendants' actions disrupted the sale."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Trespass"}], "output": "t.union(t.literal('Positive'), t.literal('Negative'))"}, "ideal": "Positive", "checked": false}
