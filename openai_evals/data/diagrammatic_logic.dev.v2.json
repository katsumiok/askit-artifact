There are also some examples of these operators in use. Work out the sequence that replaces '?', choose from the possible answers. In order to solve this problem correctly, you must consider the logical operators. If there are multiple operators applied you must they apply them left to right. In some cases the operator effect is not explicitly defined and you will need to work it out.
