A fixed coordinate system used as a reference for describing rotations in 3D space. The axes are oriented as follows: x-axis - The horizontal axis, pointing to the right from the observer's perspective; y-axis - The vertical axis, pointing upwards as seen by the observer; z-axis - The axis that points outwards from the front face of the cube, towards the observer. Rotation Convention: Positive Rotations - X: Rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise about the positive x-axis (as viewed from the right side); Y: Rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise about the positive y-axis (as viewed from the top); Z: Rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise about the positive z-axis (as viewed from the front). Negative Rotations - x: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise about the positive x-axis (as viewed from the right side); y: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise about the positive y-axis (as viewed from the top); z: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise about the positive z-axis (as viewed from the front). Your answer should only contain the number that is on the front face.
