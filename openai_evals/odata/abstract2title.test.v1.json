First, the energy release rate of the mold film is controlled successfully for an efficient transfer process, which was confirmed by contact angle measurements compared to the normal PUA. The transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS layer exhibits comparable smoothness, and also induces the favorable crystallinity of perovskite related to the spin-coated layer, which shows similar JSC and PCE (spin-coated compared to transfer printing: 12.85% compared to 12.33%), and improved VOC. The effects of the device electrical parameters are analyzed in detail by PL mapping, charge carrier mobility, and impedance response. Furthermore, the stability of the device with transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS achieved 90% retention for approximately 40\u202fdays, which was affected by the preserved crystallinity of perovskite, and the inhibition of the degradation of ITO from XRD and XPS analyses, respectively. Consequently, the transfer-printed hole extraction layer through the interface control between PUA and PEDOT:PSS using the improved hydrophobicity contributes to maintaining the surface morphologies and device electrical properties; this correlates with the stable operation of perovskite photovoltaics."}], "output": "t.str"}, "ideal": "Enhanced interface of polyurethane acrylate via perfluoropolyether for efficient transfer printing and stable operation of PEDOT:PSS in perovskite photovoltaic cells", "checked": false}
