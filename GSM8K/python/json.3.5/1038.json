Since we want to find the time it would take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we can set up the equation: 75,000 * 'x2' = 200,000 + 25,000 * 4. Solving the equation, we get 'x2' = (200,000 + 25,000 * 4) / 75,000 = 6.333. Since we cannot have a fraction of a year, we can round up to the nearest whole number.
