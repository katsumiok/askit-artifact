We know that the bull weighs 750kg.\n\n`Total amount of meat = 750kg`\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of hours it will take Prince to sell this amount of meat. Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour.\n\n`Number of hours = Total amount of meat / Amount of meat sold per hour`\n\nSubstituting the values, we have:\n\n`Number of hours = 750kg / 15kg`\n\nSimplifying the calculation:\n\n`Number of hours = 50`\n\nSo, it will take Prince 50 hours to sell the meat from Bill's bull.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of days it will take Prince. We are given that Prince works x1 hours per day, which is equal to 10 hours.\n\n`Number of days = Number of hours / Hours worked per day`\n\nSubstituting the values, we have:\n\n`Number of days = 50 hours / 10 hours`\n\nSimplifying the calculation:\n\n`Number of days = 5`\n\nTherefore, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"It will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.\", \"answer\": 5 }\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 170, "completion_tokens": 329, "total_tokens": 499}}, "recompilation_count": 0, "reason": "It will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull.", "id": 617, "question": "Prince is a butcher.
