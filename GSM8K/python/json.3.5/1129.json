We are given that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 'x1' easter eggs. In this case, 'x1' is given as 56. So, we can say that Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah together painted 56 eggs.\n\n2. We are also told that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Therefore, let's assume that they painted 'a' eggs each.\n\n3. Camden and Sarah together painted a total of 'x2' eggs, which is given as 30. So, we can say that Camden + Sarah = 30.\n\n4. It is mentioned that Camden painted 'x3' more eggs than Sarah. 'x3' is given as 12. Let's assume that Sarah painted 's' eggs. So, Camden painted 's + x3' eggs.\n\nNow, let's solve for the unknowns. \n\nSince Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we can say that Arnold = Madeline = 'a'.\n\nAnd, Camden painted 'x3' more eggs than Sarah. So, Camden = Sarah + x3 = 's + x3'.\n\nUsing the above information, we can form two equations:\n\n1. Arnold + Madeline + Camden + Sarah = 56\n2. Camden + Sarah = 30\n\nReplacing Arnold with 'a' and Camden with 's + x3' in equation 1:\n\na + a + (s + x3) + s = 56\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n2a + 2s + x3 = 56\n\nUsing equation 2, we can express 's' in terms of 'x3':\n\n(s + x3) + s = 30\n2s + x3 = 30\n2s = 30 - x3\ns = (30 - x3)/2\n\nSubstituting the value of 's' in equation 2a + 2s + x3 = 56:\n\n2a + 2((30 - x3)/2) + x3 = 56\n\nSimplifying the equation further:\n\n2a + 30 - x3 + x3 = 56\n2a + 30 = 56\n2a = 56 - 30\n2a = 26\na = 26/2\na = 13\n\nSo, we have found that 'a' is 13.\n\nTo find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we need to calculate Camden - Arnold.\n\nCamden = Sarah + x3\nPutting the value of Sarah as s = (30 - x3)/2:\nCamden = (30 - x3)/2 + x3\n          = (30 - x3 + 2x3)/2\n          = (30 + x3)/2\n\nArnold = Madeline = a = 13\n\nNumber of eggs that Camden painted more than Arnold = Camden - Arnold\n                                                     = (30 + x3)/2 - 13\n                                                     = (30 + 12)/2 - 13\n                                                     = 42/2 - 13\n                                                     = 21 - 13\n                                                     = 8\n\nTherefore, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.\n\nPutting all the values together, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Camden painted (30 + x3)/2 eggs.
