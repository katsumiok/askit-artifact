So, 1 * 20 = 20 red beads. Next, we multiply the number of packs of clear beads (2) by the number of pieces of beads in each pack (20). So, 2 * 20 = 40 clear beads. Therefore, Elizabeth has a total of 20 + 40 = 60 beads. For Margareth, we multiply the number of packs of blue beads (3) by the number of pieces of beads in each pack (20). So, 3 * 20 = 60 blue beads. Next, we multiply the number of packs of red beads (4) by the number of pieces of beads in each pack (20). So, 4 * 20 = 80 red beads. Therefore, Margareth has a total of 60 + 80 = 140 beads. To find the difference in the number of beads, we subtract the smaller total (60 for Elizabeth) from the larger total (140 for Margareth).
