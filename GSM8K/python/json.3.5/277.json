Matthew takes 'x1' minutes to dig a small hole, and he needs to dig 'x3' small holes. So the total time it will take him to dig all the small holes can be calculated as:\nTotal time for small holes = 'x1' * 'x3'\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation, we get:\nTotal time for small holes = 3 * 30\nTotal time for small holes = 90 minutes\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time for the large holes. Matthew takes 'x2' minutes to dig a large hole, and he needs to dig 'x4' large holes. So the total time it will take him to dig all the large holes can be calculated as:\nTotal time for large holes = 'x2' * 'x4'\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation, we get:\nTotal time for large holes = 10 * 15\nTotal time for large holes = 150 minutes\n\nNow, let's convert the total time for small holes and the total time for large holes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can use the following conversion factor:\n1 hour = 60 minutes\n\nConverting the total time for small holes:\nTotal time for small holes in hours = 90 / 60\nTotal time for small holes in hours = 1.5 hours\n\nConverting the total time for large holes:\nTotal time for large holes in hours = 150 / 60\nTotal time for large holes in hours = 2.5 hours\n\nFinally, to find the total time it will take Matthew to dig all the holes, we add the time for small holes and the time for large holes:\nTotal time to dig all the holes = Total time for small holes in hours + Total time for large holes in hours\n\nSubstituting the calculated values into the equation, we get:\nTotal time to dig all the holes = 1.5 + 2.5\n\nTherefore, it will take Matthew a total of 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. \n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"To find the total time, we calculate the time for small holes and large holes separately and then add them together.
