Given that the leak in both pools is emptying them out at a rate of 'x1' gallons per minute, we know that the rate of water loss is the same in both pools.\n2. 'x2' minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This means that the amount of water lost in 'x2' minutes is the same for both pools.\n3. Let's assume the initial amount of water in the small pool is 'S' gallons and in the big pool is 'B' gallons.\n4. Since both pools lose water at a rate of 'x1' gallons per minute, the amount of water lost in 'x2' minutes is 'x1 * x2'.\n5. After 'x2' minutes, the amount of water left in the small pool is 'S - x1 * x2' gallons, and in the big pool is 'B - x1 * x2' gallons.\n6. We are given that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool after 'x2' minutes. So, we can write the equation: 'B - x1 * x2 = 4 * (S - x1 * x2)'.\n7. Now, substitute the given values: 'B - 4 * 4 = 4 * (S - 4 * 4)'.\n8. Simplifying further, 'B - 16 = 4 * (S - 16)'.\n9. We know that the big pool initially had twice as much water as the small pool. So, we can write the equation: 'B = 2 * S'.\n10. Substitute 'B = 2 * S' into the previous equation: '2 * S - 16 = 4 * (S - 16)'.\n11. Simplifying further, '2 * S - 16 = 4 * S - 64'.\n12. Rearranging the equation, '2 * S - 4 * S = -64 + 16'.\n13. Simplifying, '-2 * S = -48'.\n14. Dividing by -2, 'S = 24'.\n15. Therefore, the small pool currently has 24 gallons of water. \n\nSo, the answer is:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"After solving the equations, the small pool currently has 24 gallons of water.\", \"answer\": 24 }\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 190, "completion_tokens": 511, "total_tokens": 701}}, "recompilation_count": 0, "reason": "After solving the equations, the small pool currently has 24 gallons of water.", "id": 214, "question": "Jerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
