Therefore, the number of rows of 'x3' stars can be calculated as:\nTotal rows - (rows of 'x1' stars + rows of 'x2' stars) = 76 - (3 + 4) = 76 - 7 = 69.\n\nSo, there are 69 rows of 'x3' stars altogether on the flag.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"The total number of rows of 'x3' stars is calculated by subtracting the number of rows of 'x1' and 'x2' stars from the total number of rows in the flag.\", \"answer\": 69 }\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 182, "completion_tokens": 435, "total_tokens": 617}}, "recompilation_count": 0, "reason": "The total number of rows of 'x3' stars is calculated by subtracting the number of rows of 'x1' and 'x2' stars from the total number of rows in the flag.", "id": 287, "question": "A 76-star flag has three rows of 8 stars, two rows of 6 stars and the rest are 5-star rows.
