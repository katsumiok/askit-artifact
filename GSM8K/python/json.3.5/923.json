Let's assume the number of cups in each row is represented by 'y'. So, there are 3 * y cups of chamomile and mint tea in total. Lana then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. Therefore, the remaining cups are equal to 27 - (3 * y). We can set up an equation to solve for y: 27 - (3 * y) = 15.
