First, we calculate the total minutes spent in regular classes by multiplying the number of periods per day (x1), the number of days per week (x4), and the duration of each class (x3). This gives us 6 periods * 5 days * 40 minutes = 1200 minutes. Then, we calculate the total minutes spent in extra classes by multiplying the number of extra classes (x2) and the duration of each class (x3), giving us 2 classes * 40 minutes = 80 minutes. Next, we calculate the extra learning time on weekends by dividing the sum of regular classes and extra classes by 16 (1/16) to get the extra learning time per day on weekends. This is (1200 + 80) / 16 = 80 minutes. Finally, we add up the minutes spent in regular classes, extra classes, and extra learning time on weekends to get the total learning time per week. The result is 1200 + 80 + 160 = 1440 minutes.
