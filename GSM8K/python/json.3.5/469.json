We know that each jar of sprinkles can decorate 'x2' cupcakes, so:\n\nCupcakes per jar = 'x2' = 8\n\nNext, we need to find out the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated with all of Mary's sprinkles. Since Mary has 'x1' jars of sprinkles, we can multiply the number of cupcakes per jar by the number of jars:\n\nTotal cupcakes = Cupcakes per jar * 'x1' = 8 * 6 = 48\n\nNow, we need to determine how many pans worth of cupcakes Mary should bake. Each pan can hold 'x3' cupcakes, so we can divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes per pan:\n\nPans worth of cupcakes = Total cupcakes / 'x3' = 48 / 12 = 4\n\nMary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes in order to use up all of her sprinkles.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles.\",\n  \"answer\": 4\n}\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 196, "completion_tokens": 289, "total_tokens": 485}}, "recompilation_count": 0, "reason": "Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles.", "id": 469, "question": "Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles in her pantry.
