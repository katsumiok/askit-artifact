First, we calculate the distance for half of the way around the earth:\n   - The circumference of the earth is given as 40,000 kilometers.\n   - Half of the way around the earth is equal to 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.\n\n2. Next, we calculate the number of days it will take Alfie to fly the distance of 20,000 kilometers:\n   - Alfie flies \"x1\" kilometers every day (given as 400 kilometers/day).\n   - The number of days required is equal to the total distance divided by the daily distance.\n   - Therefore, the number of days required is calculated as 20,000 / 400 = 50.\n\nSo, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Alfie needs to cover a distance of 20,000 kilometers which is half of the way around the earth.
