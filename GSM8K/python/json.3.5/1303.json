Therefore, the total number of holes dug by the dog is 6 * 14 = 84. To calculate the total number of holes filled by Nate, we multiply the number of holes filled per day (9) by the number of days Nate fills holes when he gets home (x1). Therefore, the total number of holes filled by Nate is 9 * 14 = 126. To calculate the remaining holes, we multiply the number of new holes dug by the dog every night (6) by the number of nights the dog digs holes (x1 - 1). Therefore, the remaining holes are 6 * (14 - 1) = 78. The total number of holes filled by Nate and the dog is the sum of the holes filled by Nate and the holes dug by the dog minus the remaining holes. Therefore, the total number of holes filled is 126 + 84 - 78 = 132. Finally, to calculate the number of weeks it takes to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes filled by 7, since each week has 7 days. Therefore, it takes 132 / 7 = 18.857 weeks to fill in all the holes. Since the number of weeks cannot be fractional, we round up the answer to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it takes 19 weeks to fill in all the holes.\",\n  \"answer\": 19\n}\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 770, "completion_tokens": 338, "total_tokens": 1108}}, "recompilation_count": 0, "reason": "To calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog, we multiply the number of holes dug per day (6) by the number of days Nate is on vacation (x1).
