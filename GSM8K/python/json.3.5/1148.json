First, let's convert three dozen eggs to a numerical value. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.\n\n2. Next, we divide the total number of eggs (36) by the number of children (4): \n\n   36 / 4 = 9\n\nTherefore, each child receives 9 eggs. \n\nLet's summarize the solution in a JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Three dozen eggs is equal to 36 eggs.
