Robyn sends sixteen emails a day.\n\n2. Seven of the sixteen emails are work emails. This leaves us with sixteen - seven = nine remaining emails.\n\n3. Two-thirds of the remaining nine emails are to family. To calculate this, we multiply: (9 * 2) / 3 = 6. \n\n   So, six emails are sent to family, leaving three emails.\n\n4.
