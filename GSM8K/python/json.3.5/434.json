To find out the amount of money that represents 1%, we need to divide the remaining money by 100:\n1% of remaining money = Remaining money / 100\n1% of remaining money = 380 cents / 100 = 3.8 cents.\n\nSince we know that George had 3.8 cents left, and the price of candy bars is 75 cents, we can divide the remaining money by the price of a candy bar to find out how many candy bars George bought:\nNumber of candy bars = Remaining money / Price of candy bars\nNumber of candy bars = 3.8 cents / 75 cents \u2248 0.051.\n\nHowever, we cannot have a fraction of a candy bar, so we need to round the value to the nearest whole number. In this case, since George had only 1% of his money left, it means that he did not have enough money to buy a whole candy bar. Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nGeorge bought 0 candy bars.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"George had only 1% of his money left and the price of a candy bar is greater than the remaining money.
