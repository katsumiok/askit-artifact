The total distance of the trail is 12 miles, and Marissa has already walked x2 miles in x1 hours. Given that x1 = 1 and x2 = 4, Marissa has walked 4 miles in 1 hour.\n\n2. Marissa then took another hour to walk the next two miles. This means Marissa has covered a total distance of 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours.\n\n3. We know that the average speed is equal to the total distance divided by the total time. So, the average speed is 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour.\n\n4. Marissa wants her average speed to be x3 miles per hour. Given that x3 = 4, she wants to maintain a speed of 4 miles per hour.\n\n5. To find the remaining distance, we subtract the distance already covered from the total distance: 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.\n\nTherefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance of 6 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour. \n\nThe final answer is: \n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance of 6 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour.\",\n  \"answer\": 4\n}\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 201, "completion_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 502}}, "recompilation_count": 0, "reason": "Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance of 6 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour.", "id": 19, "question": "Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail.
