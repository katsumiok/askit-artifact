Given that the cost of lemons per gallon is $3 and the cost of sugar per gallon is $2, we can calculate the total cost per gallon as $5 ($3 for lemons + $2 for sugar). Next, we need to find the number of gallons made. We know that the profit made is $25. To calculate the revenue, we multiply the number of glasses per gallon (20) by the price per glass ($0.50), which gives us $10. Then, we can calculate the cost by multiplying the total cost per gallon ($5) by the number of gallons made. Setting up the equation profit = revenue - cost, we have $25 = $10 - $5 * number of gallons made. We can isolate the variable 'number of gallons made' by subtracting $10 from both sides and dividing by $5, which gives us 3. Therefore, Juan and Carlos made 3 gallons of lemonade.
