The first train arrives in 'x1' minutes and stays for 'x2' minutes. So the waiting time for the first train is 'x1' + 'x2' = 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.\n\n2. The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station, which is 30 minutes. It stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is ('x2' / 4) minutes. So the waiting time for the second train is 30 + ('x2' / 4) = 30 + (20 / 4) = 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.\n\n3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station, which is 60 minutes. It leaves immediately after it arrives, so the waiting time for the third train is 60 minutes.\n\n4. The fourth train arrives 'x3' minutes after the third train leaves. So the waiting time for the fourth train is 'x3' minutes, which is 20 minutes in this case.\n\nNow, we can sum up the waiting times for all the trains:\n30 + 35 + 60 + 20 = 145 minutes.\n\nTherefore, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"The waiting time for each train is calculated by adding up the time between their arrival and departure.
