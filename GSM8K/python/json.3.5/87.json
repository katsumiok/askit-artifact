From the given information, we know that Sylvie just clocked 'x1' years in the company last December, where 'x1' is equal to 5.\n\nAs Sylvie has already been in the company for five years, she is eligible for a salary increase. According to the policy, the salary increases by 10% of the initial salary each year for employees who have stayed in the company for five years.\n\nLet's calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service:\n\n1. Initial salary: $600 (given)\n2. Salary increase: 10% of the initial salary\n   - 10% of $600 = $60\n3. New salary after the first year: Initial salary + Salary increase\n   - $600 + $60 = $660\n4. New salary after the second year: New salary after the first year + Salary increase\n   - $660 + $60 = $720\n5. New salary after the third year: New salary after the second year + Salary increase\n   - $720 + $60 = $780\n\nSo, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $780.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Sylvie's initial salary is $600.
