Since there are 4 blue blocks, there will be 2 * 4 = 8 yellow blocks in the tower.\n\nStep 3:\nTo find the number of red blocks, we need to subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks in the tower.\nThe total number of blocks in the tower is given by 'x2', which is 32 in this case.\n\nTotal Blocks = Blue Blocks + Yellow Blocks + Red Blocks\n\n32 = 4 (Blue Blocks) + 8 (Yellow Blocks) + Red Blocks\n\nStep 4:\nNow, let's solve for the number of red blocks by rearranging the equation:\n\nRed Blocks = Total Blocks - Blue Blocks - Yellow Blocks\n\nRed Blocks = 32 - 4 - 8\nRed Blocks = 20\n\nSo, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"The number of red blocks is calculated by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks in the tower.
