One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds.  The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?", "answer": 2, "examples": [{"input": {"x1": 4, "x2": 400, "x3": 400, "x4": 400, "x5": 55, "x6": 400, "x7": 60, "x8": 3}, "output": 2}]}
