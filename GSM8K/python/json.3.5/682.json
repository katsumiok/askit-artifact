Given that the final design length is 140cm, we can calculate the original length as 140 - (0.5 * original length + 20). Setting this equation equal to the original length, we have original length = 140 - (0.5 * original length + 20). Simplifying this equation, we can solve for the original length. Substituting the equation original length = 140 - (0.5 * original length + 20) into itself, we can solve for the original length.
