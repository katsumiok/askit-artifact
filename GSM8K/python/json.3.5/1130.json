First, we calculate the weight of the crayons by multiplying the number of crayons 'x1' with the weight of each crayon 'x4'. So, the weight of the crayons = 200 * 1 = 200 ounces. Next, we calculate the weight of the boxes by multiplying the weight of each box 'x3' with the number of boxes, which is 'x1' divided by 'x2' (as 'x2' represents the number of crayons in each box). So, the weight of the boxes = 8 * (200 / 8) = 200 ounces.
