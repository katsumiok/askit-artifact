Since the walls of the box are 'x5' = 1 inch thick, this removes 2 inches from each dimension (one for each side). So we subtract 2 from 'x2', 'x3', and 'x4' to get the internal dimensions:\n\nInternal length = 'x2' - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 inches.\nInternal width = 'x3' - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4 inches.\nInternal height = 'x4' - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 inches.\n\nNext, we calculate the inner volume of a single box. The volume of a box is given by Volume = length x width x height, so:\n\nVolume of 1 box = 3 inches x 4 inches x 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.\n\nFinally, since we have 'x6' = 'x1' = 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of a single box by the number of boxes to get the total inner volume:\n\nTotal inner volume = 3 boxes x 24 cubic inches/box = 72 cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, the total inner volume of all 'x6' = 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Subtracted 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions since walls are 1 inch thick on each side.
