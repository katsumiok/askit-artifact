Given that he is half as old as the oldest son, we can calculate this by dividing the age of the oldest son by 2. Then, we must subtract the sum of his age and the oldest son's age from the total amount of oranges to get the remaining unwashed oranges.\n\nSo, the youngest son is `x3 / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4` years old. \n\nThe oranges washed by each son will total `x3 + (x3 / 2) = 8 + 4 = 12` oranges. \n\nFinally, to find the number of unwashed oranges, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges: `x1 - (x3 + (x3 / 2)) = 15 - 12 = 3`. \n\nThis means there should be 3 oranges left unwashed. \n\nThe final answer in JSON format will look like the following:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"The oldest son washes 8 oranges while the youngest son, being half the age, washes 4 oranges.
