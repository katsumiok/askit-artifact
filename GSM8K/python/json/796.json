After that, we have to add this number to the initial number of employees. Finally, the total number of employees is multiplied by their monthly salary to get the total amount the company pays its employees.\n\nHere's the detailed calculation:\n\n1. Calculate the number of new hires: 'x1' * 3 months = 20 * 3 = 60\n2. Add this to the initial number of employees: 60 + 200 = 260\n3. Multiply the total number of employees by their monthly salary: 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000\n\nSo, the company will pay $1,040,000 to its employees over the course of three months. \n\nHere's that in JSON format:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"The total number of employees after three months is found by adding the initial number of employees to the product of the number of new hires each month and the number of months.
