First, we calculate the cost of the vaccines. Second, we calculate the cost of the heartworm check using the given percentage.\n\n'x1' represents the number of vaccines the dog needs, which is 2. Each vaccine costs $20. Multiplying 'x1' by the cost of each vaccine gives us the total cost for the vaccines.\n\nThe total cost of the heartworm check is said to be 60% of the total bill. To find this cost, we set up an equation where the total cost (100%) is equal to the cost of the vaccines plus the cost of the heartworm check (60%). We solve for the cost of the heartworm check.\n\nFinally, we calculate how much money John leaves with by subtracting the total bill from the amount of money he brought with him, which is $125.\n\nLet's calculate these now:\n\nStep 1: Cost for vaccines = 'x1' * cost per vaccine = 2 * 20 = $40.\n\nStep 2: Total cost (100%) = $40 / (1 - 0.60) = $100.\n\nStep 3: Cost for the heartworm check = Total cost - Cost for vaccines = $100 - $40 = $60.\n\nStep 4: Money left with John = Money brought - Total cost = $125 - $100 = $25.\n\nThe final JSON object would look as follows:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, the cost of the vaccines was calculated by multiplying the number of vaccines needed by the cost of each vaccine.
