Bennet sells his eggplants for $3 each and he sells 20 of them, so he makes 20 * $3 = $60 from selling eggplants.\n\nGiven that he wants to make a total of $135, we subtract the total from eggplant sales from his total goal to determine how much money he needs to make from corn. Therefore, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling corn.\n\nIf we know that he has 25 ears of corn to sell, we can calculate the price for each ear of corn by dividing the total money he needs to make from corn by the number of ears of corn. So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $75 / 25 = $3. \n\nLet's put this into JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n\"reason\": \"First, we calculated the total income from the sale of eggplants, which amounted to $60.
