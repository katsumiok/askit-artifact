Given that the first monkey eats 'x2' or 10 bananas each day, the second monkey consumes 10 + 4 = 14 bananas.\n\nFinally, to get the number of bananas the third monkey eats, we subtract the quantity of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total daily quantity. \n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Firstly, all three monkeys together eat 315 / 7 = 45 bananas in one day.
