We then multiply this by the number of reports he can staple every 15 minutes.\n\nWe know that there are 60 minutes in a hour. Therefore, in 15 hours, we have 15 * 60 = 900 minutes. Since Vince staples at a rate of 30 reports per 15 minutes, we then divide 900 by 15 to give us the total number of 15-minute cycles in 15 hours, which equals 60. \n\nFinally, we multiply this number by the number of reports Vince can staple in 15 minutes, So, our final equation for the number of reports Vince can staple reads as follows: \n\n60 (15-minute cycles) * 30 (reports per 15 minutes) = 1800 reports.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, there are 15 hours from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM which totals 900 minutes.
