Therefore, he spent half that time swimming, so he spent 6/2 = 3 hours swimming. He watched 'x2' = 3 different shows that were 'x3' = 2 hours each. So he spent a total of 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.\n\nSo, the total time spent boating, swimming, and watching shows is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (shows) = 15 hours. As it is given this was 30% of the time he spent, we complete this equation:\n15 hours = 30% * total time  \nWe rearrange to find total time: total time = 15 hours / 30% = 50 hours\n\nNow we know that John spent a total of 50 hours on his activities, and 40% was spent sightseeing. By multiplying 50 hours * 40%, we can find out how much time he spent sightseeing.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"First, we calculated the time John spent boating, swimming, and watching shows and got a total of 15 hours.
