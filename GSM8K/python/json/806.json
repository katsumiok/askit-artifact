So to get the number of fifth graders who passed, we calculate the pass rate of the fourth grade (40/100) and multiply it by 2. That would equal to 0.8. We then multiply this rate by the total number of fifth graders 'x5' to get the number of fifth graders who passed. 0.8*400 equals 320.\n\nThis means, the total number of students who passed their tests is 340 (from third grade) + 40 (from fourth grade) + 320 (from fifth grade) equaling 700.\n\nThe total number of students from all three grades is 500 (from third grade) + 100 (from fourth grade) + 400 (from fifth grade) equals 1000.\n\nDividing the total number of students who passed (700) by the total number of students in all three grades (1000) gives us the school's overall pass rate. 700/1000 equals 0.7 or 70%.
