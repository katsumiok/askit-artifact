We know that she plays half an hour every day, so in one week (7 days) she plays 7 * 1/2 = 3.5 hours. Since she's done this for 'x2' weeks, she's played a total of 3.5 * 'x2' = 3.5 * 2 = 7 hours.\n\nNext, we know she played 'x3' hours every day for another week. So that's another 7 * 'x3' = 7 * 2 = 14 hours.\n\nAdd those two amounts together, and we get a total of 7 + 14 = 21 hours played.\n\nFinally, we subtract that from 'x1', the total number of hours required for the achievement.
