Then, find out how many utensils he is left with after gifting away 'x1' spoons.\n\nThe number of measuring spoons Jonathan has initially is 2/3 of the number of cups he has. Jonathan also has two dozens of cups, and since one dozen equals 12, two dozens equal 24. Therefore, the number of spoons he has initially is (2/3)*24, which equals 16.\n\nWhen Jonathan gifts away 'x1' spoons, the number of utensils he has remaining is the initial total number of utensils minus 'x1'. Since 'x1' is equal to 6, Jonathan is left with a total of 24 cups and 16 - 6 spoons which equals 10 spoons.
