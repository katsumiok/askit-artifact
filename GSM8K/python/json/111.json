According to the statement, the boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed. So, it will take in 2/10 or 0.2 liters/foot.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many feet Julia rows per second. It took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, she rows at the speed of 20/16 or 1.25 feet/second.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how much water Julia's boat has taken in by the time she reached the shore. The shore was 'x1' or 64 seconds away. So, in this time, Julia had rowed 64 * 1.25 or 80 feet. Hence, the boat had taken in 80 * 0.2 or 16 liters of water.\n\nSo, the answer is 16.
