Then, we sum the ages of Akbar and Alessandro and subtract that total from the total age of the children to find the age of Wilfred. \n\nHere's how we can do that in detail:\n\n1. As we know: \n    The total age of the children is 20.\n    Akbar is x1 (which is 3 years old) \n    Alessandro is x2 (which is 4 years old)\n    So, the total age of Akbar and Alessandro together: x1 + x2 = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n2. We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can write this as:\n\n    2*(20/4) = 2*5 =10\n\n3. Now, to find Wilfred's age, we will subtract Akbar's age, Alessandro's age and Helene's age (which we just found out to be 10) from the total age of the children (which is 20):\n\n    Wilfred's age = 20 - (Akbar's age + Alessandro's age + Helene's age)\n                          = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10)\n                          = 20 - 17\n                          = 3\n\nSo, the age of Wilfred is 3 years.\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, I calculate the total age of Akbar and Alessandro which is 7 years.
