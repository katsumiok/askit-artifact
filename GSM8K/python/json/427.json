Given that he had $50 in spending cash and bought a ticket that cost $100, it means he earned $150 from selling his cards. \n\nKnowing that each card was sold for $1.5, we can calculate the total number of cards sold by dividing the total earnings by the price per card. In this case, it will be $150 \u00f7 $1.5 = 100 cards. \n\nHowever, Kenny only sold 2/3 of his collection, so to obtain the total number of cards, we would need to calculate the inverse of the 2/3 fraction, which is 3/2, and multiply this by the number of sold cards. Therefore, Kenny initially had 3/2 * 100 = 150 Pokemon cards.\n\nSo, this can be summarized as:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Kenny earned $150 from selling Pokemon cards at $1.5 each, making a total of 100 sold cards.
