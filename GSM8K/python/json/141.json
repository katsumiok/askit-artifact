Let's denote the number of queen bees as 'q', the number of baby bees as 'b', and the number of worker bees as 'w'. \n\nFrom the information given, we can form the following equations:\n\n1) w = 2b  (since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)\n2) b = 2q  (since there are twice as many babies as queens)\n3) w + b + q = 700 (since the total number of bees is 700)\n\nNow, from equation (2) we can substitute b from equation (1) into equation (2) to give w = 4q (since 2*b equal 2*2q which simplifies to 4q)\n\nSubstitute both 'w' and 'b' expressed in terms of 'q' into equation (3):\n\n4q + 2q + q = 700\nThis simplifies to 7q = 700\n\nTherefore, the number of queen bees 'q' is calculated as 700 / 7 = 100\n\nSubstituting q = 100 back into the equation for w that we derived above we give w = 4*100 = 400.\n\nThe final solution in JSON format should be:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"By setting up equations based on the given relationships and the total number of bees, we can solve for the number of queens, babies, and workers.
