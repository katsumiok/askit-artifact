It's also assumed that her salary remains constant throughout her working years and that the paychecks come in yearly. \n\nHere is the solution:\n\nYearly savings would be 20% of her annual salary. \n```math\nSavings per year = 20/100 * $100,000 = $20,000\n```\n\nShe plans to live off 40% of her current annual salary during her retirement period.\n```math\nYearly expenses during retirement = 40% of current salary = 40/100 * $100,000 = $40,000\n```\n\nTo know how much she needs to save for her retirement period of 'x1' years, we calculate it as:\n```math\nTotal savings needed = $40,000 * x1 years = $40,000 * 20 = $800,000\n```\n\nSo, the years she needs to work to save that amount:\n```math\nYears needed to work = Total savings needed / savings per year = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years\n```\n\nPlease note, however, that these calculations do not take into account inflation or potential salary changes.
