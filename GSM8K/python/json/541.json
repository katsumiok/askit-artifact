So, consider the daily savings in the first half of April as X, we have:\n\n15X (the total saving in the first half) + 15*2X (the total saving in the second half) = $1125, which simplifies to 45X = $1125.\n\nHence, by dividing $1125 by 45, we can get how much Elvis needs to save daily in the first half of the month. \n\nNext, since we already know Elvis plans to save twice as much in the second half of the month, we just need to multiply the daily savings in the first half by 2 to get the daily savings in the second half.\n\nHere is the JSON response with the solution: \n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"To find out the daily saving for the second half of April, we first calculate the total daily saving for all of April (1125 USD) and divide it by 45 (considering Elvis saves twice as much in the second half of the month).
