Tim spends 6 hours each day answering phones. But, we need to convert this to minutes because the time it takes him to deal with a call is in minutes. So, multiply six hours by 60 to get 360 minutes.\n2. It takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with one call. Therefore, to find out how many calls he can manage per day, divide 360 by 15. The result is 24 calls per day.\n3. To find out how many calls he can manage during his 5-day work week, multiply 24 calls by 5 days.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, convert Tim's daily working hours into minutes (6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes).
