First, we would need to determine the total number of shoes James buys in one year. Since he buys 'x1' pairs of shoes every month and there are 12 months in a year, we need to multiply 'x1' by 12. It's given that 'x1' equals 2, so he buys 2*12 = 24 pairs of shoes in a year.\n2. Second, we have to divide the total amount he spends, which is $2640, by the total number of pairs of shoes he buys to find out how much he spends on average on each pair. So, we divide $2640 by 24.\n3. Do the math\n\nSo on average, James spends $2640/24 = $110 per pair of shoes. \n\nLet's put this into JSON format:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we found out that James buys 24 pairs of shoes each year by multiplying the given pair of shoes he buys each month 'x1' (which equals to 2) by 12 (months in a year).
