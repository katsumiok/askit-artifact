We know that Duncan's age now (x1) is 60, therefore, eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old. So, 'd' = 52.\n\nAccording to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years from then. So, 'a' should be 'd'/2 = 52/2 = 26 years old. That's Adam's age four years ago. So, Adam's current age is 26 + 4 = 30 years old.\n\nOur task is to find how old Adam will be in 'x2' years, where 'x2' is given as 8.
