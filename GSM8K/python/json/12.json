Initial cost to plant the tree = $90\n1. Annual maintenance cost (water and food) = $3\n\nNext, identify all the sources of income Carlos has from his lemon tree:\n\n1. Carlos sells each lemon for $1.5 and from each tree he gets 'x1' = 7 lemons.\n\nSo, his annual income from each tree is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.\n\nNow let's calculate after how many years he starts earning. \n\nEach year Carlos earns $10.5 - $3 = $7.5. \n\nHe has already invested $90 for setting up the tree, so to cover up this cost from his annual earnings, it would take Carlos $90 / $7.5 = 12 years. So, after 12 years, Carlos would start earning from his lemon tree.\n\nTherefore, the JSON response is:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Each year Carlos earns $7.5 from each lemon tree.
