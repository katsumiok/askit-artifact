At a speed of 440 feet/minute, Steve will take 15840 feet \u00f7 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes to get home.\n\nSimilarly, the distance Tim needs to travel is 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet. At a speed of 264 feet/minute, Tim will take 10560 feet \u00f7 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes to get home.\n\nSo, Steve, who gets home first, will be waiting for Tim for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the winner will be waiting 4 minutes at their house before the loser finishes the race.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Convert the distances of Steve and Tim in miles to feet where 1 mile is 5280 feet.
