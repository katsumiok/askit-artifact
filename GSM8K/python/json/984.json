We will use feet as the measurement unit since the length of the flower bed is given in feet.\n\nSecondly, we convert the width of each plant which is x2 = 12 inches to feet by dividing by 12, on the basis that 1 foot = 12 inches. Therefore, each plant occupies a space of 12/12 = 1 feet.\n\nThe total space each plant needs is 1 feet (for the plant growth) plus 1.5 feet for the space between plants, making it 2.5 feet per plant.\n\nWe calculate the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed of x1 = 111 feet long by dividing 111 feet by 2.5 feet/plant. \n\nSubtract the number of plants Pat already owns which is x3 = 17 from the total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed. This gives us the number of plants Pat needs to buy. \n\nThen multiply the number of plants Pat needs to buy by the cost of each plant which is $6 to get the total cost.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nStep 1:\nConvert x2 to feet:\nx2 = 12 inches = 12/12 feet = 1 foot\n\nStep 2:\nDetermine the space each plant needs:\nSpace per plant = space for growth + space between plants\n= 1 foot + 1.5 feet\n= 2.5 feet\n\nStep 3:\nCalculate total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed:\nTotal plants = Length of bed / Space per plant\n= x1 / space per plant\n= 111 feet / 2.5 feet/plant\n= 44.4 plants \u2248 44 plants (since we can't have a part of a plant)\n\nStep 4:\nCalculate number of plants Pat needs to buy:\nPlants to buy = Total plants - plants Pat owns \n= 44 - x3\n= 44 - 17\n= 27 plants\n\nStep 5:\nCalculate total cost:\nCost = number of plants to buy * cost per plant\n= 27 plants * $6/plant\n= $162\n\nSo, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.\n\nThe result in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we converted the plant size to the same unit as the flower bed size (feet).
