As Cameron arrives at the hotel at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am next morning, the total length of his stay is 17 hours. \n\nSince the hotel has a 12-hour package for 'x1' peso, which is 1000 pesos in our case, Cameron can pay for that. However, since he stayed for 5 more hours, he has to pay an additional 'x7' pesos per hour on top of the 12-hour rate. 'x7' is 70 in our case. Therefore, the additional cost will be 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.\n\nSo, the total expense for Cameron if he chooses the pay-per-hour option after the 12-hour mark will be 1000 (for the first 12 hours) + 350 (for the next 5 hours) = 1350 pesos. \n\nOn the other hand, if he chose to pay for the 24-hour package (even though he did not need that much), it would have cost him 'x2' pesos, which is 1600 pesos in our case.\n\nThus, by choosing the pay-per-hour option, Cameron is able to save 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.\n\nLet's format this information in JSON:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Cameron stayed at the hotel for a total of 17 hours.
