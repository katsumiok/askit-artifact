Since each bottle of juice covers 20% of daily energy demand, then 100%/20% = 5 bottles are needed. This simply means that one person requires 5 bottles for their full day's energy demand. \n\nSecond, we must determine the total number of bottles required to meet 100% energy demand of 'x3' people. As 'x3' = 2300, then 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the daily energy need for 2300 people.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of bottles Hortex company is currently producing ('x1' = 4200 bottles) from the total number of bottles required (11500).
