She bought ten boards for $10 each, which equals $100 in total. Moreover, she also purchased five boards for $16 each, which equals $80. Thus, the initial cost for all the boards is $100 + $80 which equals $180. \n\nAfter the price of lumber went up by 50%, it means they're now worth 1.5 times their original price. So, the selling price for the ten'x1'x'x2'x'x3' boards, which initially cost $10 each, is now $15 each. And the selling price for the five'x4'x'x5'x'x6' boards, which originally cost $16 each, is now $24 each. \n\nTherefore, the revenue from selling all the lumber is (10 * $15) + (5 * $24), which is $150 + $120, equal to $270.\n\nThe profit is calculated by subtracting the initial cost from the revenue. So the profit is $270 - $180 which equals $90.\n\nSo, the final JSON response would be:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First calculated the initial cost of both the lumber types, which turns out to be $180.
