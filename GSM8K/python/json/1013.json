This totals to $25 per hour.\n\nNext, we determine what 20% of the cost of the $10000 car is, which gives us $2000.\n\nThen, we calculate how many hours she needs to work to earn $2000. The result is $2000 divided by $25 per hour, which gives us 80 hours.\n\nLastly, we determine how many weeks she needs to work to accumulate this many hours, assuming she works 'x1' hours a week (40 hours). This requires us to divide the total hours (80) by 'x1' (40). We obtain 2 weeks.\n\nThus, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks.\n\nThis logic is represented in JSON format below:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Given Janet earns 10 dollars from wages and 15 dollars from tips, her total hourly earnings is 25 dollars.
