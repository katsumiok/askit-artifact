The time taken to cook pork is `x1` minutes more than the time taken to cook rice.

The time taken to cook beans is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the time taken to cook beans is `(x2 + (x2 + x1)) / 2` = (30 + 50) / 2 = 40 minutes.\n\nTo find the total time taken to cook all the food, we add up the time taken to cook each item: `x2 + (x2 + x1) + (x2 + (x2 + x1)) / 2`, this equals to 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Firstly, the time to cook pork is 'x1' minutes more than the time to cook rice.
