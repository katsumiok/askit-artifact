Total cost can be calculated as (advance payment + (monthly installment * number of installments)).\n\nFor Furniture United, advance payment is $1,350 and monthly installment amount is $350 with 6 installments. So total cost = $1,350 + (6 * $350) = $3,450.\n\nFor Cozy Homes, advance payment is $1,100 and monthly installment amount is $250 with 9 installments. So total cost = $1,100 + (9 * $250) = $3,350.\n\nSo, the cost difference between the two offers is = Furniture United's total cost - Cozy Homes' total cost = $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"By calculating total costs of each company offer and then subtracting Cozy Homes' total cost from Furniture United's total cost, we get the difference.\", \"answer\": 100 }\n```"}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 201, "completion_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 412}}, "recompilation_count": 0, "reason": "By calculating total costs of each company offer and then subtracting Cozy Homes' total cost from Furniture United's total cost, we get the difference.", "id": 333, "question": "Robert wants to buy a bookshelf and a sofa and has received two offers.
