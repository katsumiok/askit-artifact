Given that the one-way distance to his office is 'x2' miles and he drives to and from work 5 days a week, the total distance he drives per week would be 2*x2*5. \n\nThen, we can calculate how many gallons of gas he needs per week by dividing the total distance by his car's fuel efficiency 'x1' MPG. \n\nFinally, multiplying the gas needed by the cost per gallon gives the total cost of the fuel consumed per week.\n\nLet's plug in the given 'x1' and 'x2' into the formula:\n\n  Total distance per week = 2 * 'x2' miles/day * 5 days/week = 2 * 5 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.\n  \n  Gallons of gas needed per week = Total distance / 'x1' MPG = 50 miles/week / 10 MPG = 5 gallons/week.\n  \n  Cost of gas per week = Gallons * Cost/gallon = 5 gallons/week * $3/gallon = $15/week. \n\nSo, Andy's car is consuming $15 worth of gas per week. \n\nPutting it into the JSON format gives:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"The total distance driven in a week for work is 5*2*5 miles.
