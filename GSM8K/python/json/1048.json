After that, we apply the yearly depreciation rate to the original price for the number of years that have passed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the depreciation for the first year. To do that we multiply the initial price by the depreciation rate (20000 * 21% = 4200).\n\nThe price of the car at the end of the first year is the initial price minus the depreciation (20000 - 4200 = 15800).\n\nFor the second and third year, we repeat the same calculation but using the price at the end of each previous year. \n\nFor the second year, 15800 * 21% = 3324. Its price at the end of the second year is 15800 - 3324 = 12476.\n\nFor the third year, 12476 * 21% = 2620. The price of the car at the end of the third year (2010) is 12476 - 2620 = 9856.\n\nSo, the price of the car in the year 2010 would be approximately $9856.\n\nThis solution is given in the JSON format below:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.
