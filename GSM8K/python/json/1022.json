According to the problem, L=S/2 and each large stuffed animal costs 3 times more the price of each small one, so 3L*S + S*S = $120. Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, 4S + 3L*S = $120. \n\nSubstitute L=S/2 into the equation: 4S + 3(S/2)*S = $120, which simplifies to 4S + 1.5S^2 = $120.\n\nThis equation is a quadratic equation that can be solved for S. When solving this equation, we find the one positive solution which is S = 8.\n\nSo, Teresa sold 8 small stuffed animals.\n\nThe final JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Given that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals and she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, we can establish a relationship between the cost of small and large stuffed animals and the total earnings from sales.
