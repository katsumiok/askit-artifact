Substituting the values, we have:\n   \n   Shoplifters' count = 4 * 3 - 5 = 7\n\nThirdly, the number of people evicted due to physical violence is defined as three times the number of shoplifters, which gives us:\n\n   Physical violence count = 3 * 7 = 21\n\nCombining all the counts, we have a total of 3 (masks) + 7 (shoplifters) + 21 (physical violence) = 31.\n\nThe total number of people kicked out according to the problem is 'x2' which is 50.\n\nHence, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is:\n\n'x2' - all the counts calculated above , so it would be: \n\n50 (total) - 31 (already accounted) = 19\n\nLet's summarize this solution in a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we find out how many people were kicked out for not wearing masks, shoplifting, and physical violence, which gives us a total of 31.
