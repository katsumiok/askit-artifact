The area of a rectangle is length times width, so the north/south walls each have an area of 10 * 8 = 80 square feet and the east/west walls each have an area of 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. The total wall area is then (2 * 80) + (2 * 40) = 240 square feet.\n\nNext, determine how many gallons of paint are needed by dividing the total wall area by the area a gallon of paint can cover. So, 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint are needed.\n\nFinally, find the total cost of the paint by multiplying the number of gallons needed by the cost per gallon.
