So, the profit = Increased value - (Cost of house + repair cost) = 200,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = $70,000.\n\nSo, Josh made a profit of $70,000.\n\nLet's format this information into a JSON format:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we calculated 150% of the original house price, which was $120,000.
