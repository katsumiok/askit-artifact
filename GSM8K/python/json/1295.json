This can be determined by multiplying the number of weeks he completed his chores by the weekly allowance amount. Then we can calculate the total cost of buying ice cream cones for all friends including Ryan by multiplying the number of total people (Ryan and his friends) by the price of each ice cream. After finding the total expense on ice cream, we can subtract this amount from the total allowance to find out the remaining amount. Finally, to find out the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the remaining amount by the price of one movie ticket. \n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nRyan's Total Allowance = 'Allowance per week' * 'weeks of chores done' = $6 * 3 = $18\nTotal Expense on Ice cream = 'Number of Cones (including Ryan)' * 'Cost per cone' = (3 friends + 1 Ryan) * $1.25 = 4 * $1.25 = $5\nRemaining amount = 'Total Allowance' - 'Cost of the ice cream' = $18 - $5 = $13\nNumber of movie tickets Ryan can buy = 'Remaining Amount' \u00f7 'Cost per ticket' = $13 \u00f7 $6.50 = 2 (Ignoring any fractional parts because we can't buy fractional tickets) \n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, I calculated the total allowance earned by Ryan ($18).
