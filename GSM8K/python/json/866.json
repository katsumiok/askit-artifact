Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn does, so Anne's books = Fawn's books - 12 (x3).\n\nBy replacing Anne's books in x2 with its equivalent from x3, we get Sofie's books = Fawn's books - 12 + 25. Therefore Sofie's books = Fawn's books + 13.\nFrom this, we can set up an equation of total books:\nFawn's books (F) + Sofie's books (F+13) + Anne's books (F-12) = 85.\n\nSo we need to solve 3F + 1 = 85, which simplifies to F = (85 - 1) / 3 = 28.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"By using the information of relative book numbers between Sofie, Anne, and Fawn, we could express the books that Sofie and Anne have in terms of Fawn's books.
