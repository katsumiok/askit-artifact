As Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as much as she did Joe's, she was paid 3 * $6 = $18 for her work. The following week, Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as much as she did Joe's, so she was paid 5 * $6 = $30.\n\nSo, Tasha made a total of $6 (Joe) + $18 (Kamala) + $30 (Alba) = $54 from mowing lawns.\n\nSubtracting this amount from her total earnings will give us how much she made from selling lemonade.
