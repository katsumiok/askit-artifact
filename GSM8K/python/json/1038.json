In this case, 'x1' equals 4, so the total amount of loans is 50,000$ x 4 = 200,000$.\n\nFor the years he is in college, he can't work, so he doesn't earn his previous salary. We multiply his previous salary (25,000$) by the number of years he's studying: 25,000$ x 4 = 100,000$.\n\nThus, the total sum (loans + lost earnings) equals 200,000$ + 100,000$ = 300,000$.\n\nNow let's calculate how long it will take him to earn this amount. Jim tripled his income, so now he earns 25,000$ x 3 = 75,000$ per year.
