Since she bought 5 dozens and each dozen costs $2.40, she spent 5 * $2.40 = $12. \n\nNext, let's find out how many eggs Rose have. Since a dozen is 12, 5 dozens are 5*12 = 60 eggs.\n\nThen, she's selling these eggs for $1 for every 3 eggs (=='x1'). Therefore, we can find out the total selling price by multiplying 'x1' price times the total eggs divided by 'x1'. That is $1 * (60 / 3) = $20.\n\nThe profit is the selling price minus the cost, therefore, Rose's profit will be $20 - $12 = $8.\n\nSo, the JSON response should be:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, the total cost that Rose paid for the eggs is calculated by multiplying the cost of one dozen eggs ($2.40) by the number of dozens bought (5), resulting in a total cost of $12.
