Multiply cost of each lollipop by number of lollipops bought initially which is 5 * $0.40 = $2.00\n2. Subtract this amount from the total cost initially spent, i.e., $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20. This gives the total cost of the 4 candies.\n3. Now, the cost of one candy = $1.20 / 4 = $0.30\n\nLet's then compute the price of buying x1 lollipops and x2 candies using the prices we obtained:\n1. Cost for 10 lollipops = 10 * $0.40 = $4.00\n2. Cost for 10 candies = 10 * $0.30 = $3.00\n\nFinally, to find the total cost of x1 lollipops and x2 candies, we add the individual costs which is $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00\n\nSo, if Manolo buys 10 lollipops and 10 candies, it would cost him $7.00.\n\nExpressed in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we found the cost of one candy by subtracting the total cost of lollipops from the total initial cost and dividing it by the number of candies.
