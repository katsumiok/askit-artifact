Since each bag of chips costs 'x1' cents, and he bought 'x3' bags, he spent 'x1' * 'x3' cents on chips.\n\nThen, we subtract this amount from the total money George spent, which is $5 or 500 cents, to find out how much he spent on candy bars.\n\nFinally, if 1% of his money was left, this means George spent 99% of his money. Hence, we would compare the amount spent on chips and candy bars combined against 99% of the total money he had. The difference would be the cost of the candy bars bought. We then divide this by the cost 'x2' of each candy bar to find the number of candy bars bought. \n\nLet's implement this calculation.\n\nGiven:\n   'x1' = 40\n   'x2' = 75\n   'x3' = 3\n\n1. George spent 'x1' * 'x3' = 40 * 3 = 120 cents on chips.\n2. Total money George had was 500 cents (equivalent to $5.)\n3. Hence, the money spent on candy bars was 99% of 500 - 120 = 480 cents.\n4. Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought was 480 / 75 = 6.4.\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to get the final answer.\n\nHere is the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we calculated the amount George spent on chips which is 120 cents.
