From the given conditions, Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3*'x1' = 3*21 which is 63 years old. Further, Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack is 2*'x1' = 2*21 which is 42 years old.\n\nNow let's calculate each person's age in three years. That means Harriet will be 'x1'+3 = 21+3 which is 24 years old. Adrian will be 63 + 3 which is 66 years old. Zack will be 42 + 3 which is 45 years old.\n\nThen, to find the average of the three ages, we sum them up and divide by the number of people. So (24+66+45)/3 = 135/3 which is 45.\n\nSo, the average age of the three in three years will be 45.\n\nLet's put this in JSON format:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, I calculated Adrian's and Zack's current age based on Harriet's age.
