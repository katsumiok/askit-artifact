Based on the given conditions, he won't have to turn his homework in if:\n1. There's a substitute teacher (50% chance) OR\n2. His normal teacher provides an extension (40% chance). However, this can only happen if the normal teacher is there, which is a 50% chance. So, the actual probability of this scenario is 50% * 40% = 20% OR\n3. Marcus convinces the teacher that his dog ate his homework (20% chance). This can only happen if there is no substitute and no extension, both events have a 50% and 60% chance of not happening respectively. So, the actual probability of this scenario is 50% * 60% * 20% = 6%.\n\nTo get the overall percentage chance that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework, we add up these three scenarios: 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%\n\nTherefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow = 100% - chance he won't = 100% - 76% = 24%.\n\nSo, the final answer would be:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we calculate the probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework, which can occur due to a substitute teacher (50%), teacher-provided extension (20%), or Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate his assignment (6%).
