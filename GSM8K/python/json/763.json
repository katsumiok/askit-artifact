House 1 needs half of what House 2 needs \u2192 a = b/2.\n2. House 3 needs double of what House 1 needs \u2192 c = 2*a.\n\nAlso, the total number of cases needed for all three houses equals 'x1' which is 250.\n\nThat suggests the equation: a + b + c = 250.\n\nLet's use conditions to rewrite our main equation in terms of 'b' (House 2):\na becomes b/2, c becomes 2*b/2 which simplifies to b.\n\nThat transforms our equation to: b/2 + b + b = 250,\nwhich simplifies to: 5/2*b = 250.\n\nTo find 'b', multiply both sides by 2/5: b = (2/5)*250 = 100.\n\nFinally, to calculate the number of cases House 3 will need, we use the condition c = 2*a. First convert a to what it equals in terms of b: a = b/2 = 100/2 = 50. \nThen calculate c, substituting a: c = 2*50 = 100.
