Group 1 will contain glasses that are priced at $5 each, and Group 2 glasses that are 60% cheaper.\n\nSince every second glass is cheaper, half of the glasses will be in Group 1, and the other half in Group 2. Therefore, if there are 16 glasses, 8 will be in Group 1 and 8 in Group 2.\n\nTo find the total price, we have to calculate the sum of the prices in both groups. For Group 1, since each glass is $5, we multiply 8 by 5. For Group 2, since each glass is 60% cheaper, each one will cost $2. Therefore, we multiply 8 by 2.\n\nFinally, we add the total cost of Group 1 and Group 2 together to find the final price.\n\nLet's put this in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Divide the total number of glasses (16) into two groups, where each group contains half the total number of glasses (8).
