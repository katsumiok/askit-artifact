The time he spends doing rounds can be calculated by multiplying the number of inpatients ('x1') by the time it takes each round (20 mins). Similarly, the time taken for appointments can be found by multiplying the number of appointments (10) by the time for each appointment (30 mins). \n\nFinally, the total time spent on these two tasks in hours is subtracted from the total time he spends at work (9 hours) to determine the remaining time for updating his records.\n\nLet's plug in the value of 'x1' = 9.\n\nThe time spent on rounds = 9 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 180 minutes = 3 hours.\nAnd, the time for appointments = 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes = 5 hours.\n\nSo, the total time spent on rounds and appointments = 3 + 5 = 8 hours.\n\nFinally, the remaining time for records = 9 hours (total time at work) - 8 hours (time spent on rounds and appointments) = 1 hour.\n\nThis calculation will be illustrated in JSON format as follows. \n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"The time spent on rounds is calculated by multiplying the number of inpatients ('x1'=9) by 20 minutes which gives 180 minutes or 3 hours.
