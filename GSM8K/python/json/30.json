We know their ages are in the ratio 7:11 and their total age is currently 162 years. So, we can set up the equation as 7x + 11x = 162 where 'x' is the common multiplier. Solving for 'x' gives us the individual ages of Darrell and Allen. Once we have Allen's current age, we can add 'x1' years to calculate how old he will be 'x1' years from now.\n\nStep-by-step calculations:\n1. Solve the equation 7x + 11x = 162 => 18x = 162 => x = 9.\n2. Allen's current age = 11 * x = 11 * 9 = 99 years.\n3. Allen's age 'x1' years, i.e., 10 years from now = current age + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109 years.\n\nSo, Allen will be 109 years old 'x1' years from now, where 'x1' is 10 years.\n\nThus, in JSON format it would look as:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we calculate the common factor 'x' from the ratio and total age.
