First, if Jame will be 27 in 5 years, that means he is currently 22 years old.\n\nNext, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age. In 8 years, Jame will be 30.5 years old. Twice his age then will be 61, so, subtracting 5, his cousin will be 56 in 8 years.\n\nNow, since these evaluations are 8 years in the future, we subtract these 8 years to find the cousin's current age, which is 48 years old.\n\nSo, the current difference in age between Jame and his cousin is 48 - 22 = 26 years.\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"By solving the problem step-by-step first Jame's age was calculated then his cousin's age in future and present.
