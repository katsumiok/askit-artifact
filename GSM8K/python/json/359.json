To do this, we will multiply the number of gumballs he bought, which is 'x1' or 40, by the cost per gumball, which is $.05. This will give us the amount spent on gumballs in dollars.\n\nAfter this, we will multiply this amount by 2, as Billy spent only half his change on gumballs, to find out the total change he had left after buying the candy.\n\nThen, we will subtract this total change from the initial amount of money he had, which was $10, to find out the cost of candy.\n\nFinally, we will divide the cost of candy by the cost per pound, which is $1.5. This will give us the number of pounds of candy Billy bought.\n\nThe calculation can be formulated as follows: \n\n(10 - 2 * (40 * 0.05)) / 1.5\n\nNow let's enclose this in JSON format.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"The reason is as follows: To find out the amount spent on gumballs, we multiplied the number of gumballs (40) by the cost per gumball ($.05), making $2.
