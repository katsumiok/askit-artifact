Therefore, she needs to cover 9,300/30 = 310 miles per day. \n\nFurther, we know that Soledad is already planning to hike 125 miles twice a day. This means she is already covering 250 miles per day (125 miles * 2). \n\nSo, to find the additional distance she needs to cover to meet her goal, we subtract the miles she is already planning to cover from the daily goal. That is 310 miles - 250 miles = 60 miles. \n\nSo, Soledad needs to hike an additional 60 miles per day.\n\nThe JSON response would be:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Soledad needs to cover 9300 miles in 30 days which is 310 miles per day.
