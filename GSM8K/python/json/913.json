Therefore, we have 2*20 pieces of bologna for the red balloons (since there are 20 red balloons) and 3*y for the yellow balloons (since there are y yellow balloons).\n\nThe total quantity of bologna Benny threw (x1) is the sum of the bologna for the red and yellow balloons, which gives us the equation: 2*20 + 3*y = x1.\n\nWe're told that x1 equals 58. So we substitute x1 with 58 in the equation.
