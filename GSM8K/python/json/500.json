Let's substitute the third equation into the first one:\nl + b/2 + b = 43\n=> l + 3/2*b = 43\n=> 2*l + 3*b = 86\n\nRemembering that l = d + 7,\nwe substitute d in the equation above:\n2*(b/2 + 7) + 3*b = 86\n=> b + 14 + 3*b = 86\n=> 4*b = 72\n=> b = 18\n\nSubstituting the value of b into the second equation,\nd = b/2\n=> d = 18/2\n=> d = 9\n\nFinally, we substitute the value of d in the first equation,\nl = d + 7\n=> l = 9 + 7\n=> l = 16\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we define the variables 'l', 'd' and 'b' for the number of insects that Lily, David and Bodhi respectively found.
