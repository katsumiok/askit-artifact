Then, knowing that Arnold and Madeline painted an equal number of eggs, we can divide their total by 2 to find the number each of them painted. \n\nNext, we can calculate the number of eggs Sarah painted by subtracting Camden's extra painted eggs (x3) from the total painted by Camden and Sarah (x2). This gives us Camden's total painted eggs.\n\nFinally, we can subtract the number of eggs painted by Arnold from the number painted by Camden to find the difference.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. Find combined amount of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline: x1 - x2.\n2. Divide this sum by 2 to get the number of eggs painted by Arnold: (x1 - x2)/2.\n3. Determine the number of eggs painted by Sarah: x2 - x3.\n4. Calculate the number of eggs painted by Camden: x2 - (x2 - x3).\n5. Subtract the amount Arnold painted from the amount Camden painted: Camden's eggs - Arnold's eggs.\n\nNote: We assume certain variables need to be deducted as they were previously added in the problem.\n\nThe JSON response will be as below:\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"First we find the combined amount of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline by subtracting the total painted by Camden and Sarah from the total painted.
