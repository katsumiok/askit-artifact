His birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st. This means Andy has 200 days to reach his weight loss goal. \n\nNext, we will calculate how many total calories Andy needs to burn in order to lose his target weight. Given the relation x2 = 3500 calories per pound, Andy needs to burn a total of x1 * x2 calories, which means 30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories.\n\nFinally, we divide the total calories by the total number of days to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day. This would be 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day. \n\nThis will be the daily calorie deficit that Andy needs to maintain in order to meet his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Andy has 200 days to meet his weight loss goal.
