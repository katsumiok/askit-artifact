As per the problem, the dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time it takes the cat. This means, the dog takes 2/3 x 30 = 20 minutes to eat the sausages. \n\nNext, we determine the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. This is calculated as (time taken by cat + time taken by dog) / number of animals = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2 = 25 minutes.\n\nThe answer is thus 25 minutes.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we calculate the time taken by the dog to eat the sausages, which is 2/3 times the time taken by the cat, resulting in 20 minutes.
