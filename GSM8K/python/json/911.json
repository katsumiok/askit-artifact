This is found by subtracting 'x1' from 'x2', which will give us the actual number of packages he completes each hour. Once we know this number, we multiply it by Colby's rate of $0.20 per package to find out how much he earns every hour. Lastly, we multiply his hourly earnings by the number of hours he works in a typical workday (in this case, 8 hours) to find out his total daily earnings.\n\nLet's calculate:\nNumber of packages per hour: 'x2' - 'x1' = 50 - 10 = 40 packages.\nHourly earnings: 40 packages * $0.20/package = $8.00.\nDaily earnings: hourly earnings * number of hours = $8.00 * 8 hours = $64.00.\n\nSo, Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday.\n\nHere is the JSON representation of the above result:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"With the given values, the total number of packages Colby completes per hour is 40 (50 - 10).
