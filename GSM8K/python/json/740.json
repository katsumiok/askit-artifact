As per the data given, 'x2' = 10 students like to bake and 'x3' = 5 students like to play basketball. Therefore, the total number of students who either bake or play basketball is 10 + 5 = 15.\n\nThen, we subtract this number from the total number of students 'x1' = 50 to find the number of students who either play video games or music. So, there are 50 - 15 = 35 students who either play video games or music.\n\nNow, let's assume the number of students who like to play music as 'y' and those who like to play video games as 'z'. The problem provides us with the condition that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, which gives us the equation y = 2 * 'x3' => y = 2 * 5 = 10. \n\nThose remaining must therefore like video games, so we subtract the number who like to play music from our remaining total: z = 35 - y => z = 35 - 10 = 25. \n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, the total number of students who either bake or play basketball was found by adding these two values together, giving 15.
