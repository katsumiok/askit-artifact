Since the state has a 20% tax rate, the taxes for this job will be $6,000 (30,000 * 0.2), resulting in a net pay of $24,000 (30,000 - 6,000).\n\nNow, let's calculate the net pay for job B.\n\nJob B pays $42,000 a year, and the state charges $6,000 in property taxes. This means the net income after property tax is $36,000 (42,000 - 6,000). Then, a 10% tax rate is applied to this amount, resulting in $3,600 in additional tax (36,000 * 0.1). Thus, the net pay for job B is $32,400 (36,000 - 3,600).\n\nFinally, comparing the net pays of both jobs, Nick makes $8,400 more on job B than on job A. \n\nHere's this information in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, resulting in a gross income of $30,000.
