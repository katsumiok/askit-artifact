If there are 'x1' weeks in a month, monthly expenditure on food will be $25 * 'x1'. Treats cost her $20 per month. Medicine costs her $100 per month. Thus, her total monthly expenditure becomes $25*x1 + $20 + $100. To calculate yearly expenditure, multiply the total monthly expenditure by 12. \n\nGiven 'x1' = 4, we substitute this value in our calculations.  \n\nTotal monthly expenditure becomes $25*4 + $20 + $100 = $100 + $20 + $100 = $220. \nYearly then becomes $220 * 12 = $2640. \n\nPlease note that this calculation assumes that there are exactly 4 weeks in every month.
