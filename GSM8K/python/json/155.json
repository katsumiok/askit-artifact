In this case we'll convert inches to feet since the final answer needs to be in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot. So, we'll divide the length of rolls and croissants by 12 to convert them to feet.\n\nNext, we calculate the length of each type of baked good by multiplying the quantity by the length:\n- The total length of the rolls in feet is x1 * x4 = 300 * (4/12) = 100 feet.\n- The total length of the croissants in feet is x2 * x5 = 120 * (6/12) = 60 feet.\n- The total length of the baguettes in feet is x3 * 2 = 60 * 2 = 120 feet.\n\nFinally, we add the lengths of all the baked goods to find the total length. Therefore, the total length would be 100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet.\n\nSo, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long.\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we convert the measurements to the same unit (feet).
