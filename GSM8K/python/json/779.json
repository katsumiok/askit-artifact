First, subtract 'x3' from half of 'x2' to obtain the hiking speed. Then, multiply the driving speed ('x2') by the driving time (which is 'x1' minus 1.5, since 1.5 hours were spent hiking) to find the distance they drove. Add this to the distance they hiked (hiking speed multiplied by hiking time of 1.5 hours) to get the total distance.\n\nNow let's substitute the given values into these steps:\nHiking speed = (50/2) - 5 = 20 mph.\nDriving time = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.\nDriving distance = 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.\nHiking distance = 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.\nTotal distance = 225 + 30 = 255 miles.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Firstly, we find the hiking speed by substracting 'x3' from half of 'x2', we get that is 20 mph.
