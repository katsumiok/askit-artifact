So, for a week, Roger needs 7 pounds of coffee.\n\nThe more expensive coffee brand costs 20% more than $5 per pound. So, to calculate the cost of coffee for a week, we need to:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee brand\n2. Multiply that by 7 to get the weekly cost of coffee\n3. Add the cost of the donut\n\nLet's execute the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee brand: $5 + ($5 * 20 / 100) = $6\n2. Weekly cost of coffee: $6 * 7 = $42\n3.
