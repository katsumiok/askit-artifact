Then, we will multiply each quantity by the corresponding bicycle's price.\n\n1. First, calculate the number of Trekking bikes sold:\n   It's mentioned that half of 'x1' (300) are Trekking bikes. So, the number of Trekking bikes sold is 300 / 2 = 150.\n\n2. Subtract the number of Trekking bikes sold from 'x1' to find out the total number of BMX and MTB bikes sold: 300 - 150 = 150.\n\n3. Find the number of BMX bikes sold: \n   As stated, 15% of 'x1' (300) are BMX bikes. So, the number of BMX bikes sold is 15/100 * 300 = 45.\n\n4. Subtract the number of BMX bikes sold from the total number of BMX and MTB bikes sold to find out the number of MTB bikes sold: 150 - 45 = 105.\n\nNow, calculate the total amount of money earned:\n\n1. Multiply the number of each type of bike sold by its price: \n   - Trekking bikes: 150 * 450 = $67,500\n   - BMX bikes: 45 * (500/2) = $11,250 (since BMX price is half of MTB)\n   - MTB bikes: 105 * 500 = $52,500\n\n2. Sum these amounts to get the total earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 =$131,250\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"We calculated the number of each type of bike sold, based on the given percentages and total.
