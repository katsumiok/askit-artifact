Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.\n2. That means John's age at that time was `x1/2 - 6`. Subtract 6 because it was six years ago.\n3. As per given, six years ago, Chile's population was `x2` times the age of Noah. So, Chile's population at that time was `x2 * (x1/2 - 6)`.\n4. It was also given that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now.\n5. Thus, the current population of Chile is `2 * (x2 * (x1/2 - 6))`.\n\nBy substituting `x1 = 46` and `x2 = 3000`, the current population of Chile can be calculated with the above formula. Let's calculate:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"First, find Noah's age six years ago which is half of Cera's age at that time, giving 46/2 - 6 = 17.
