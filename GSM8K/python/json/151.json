Each bicycle has 2 tires and 'x1' cents is charged for inflating a single tire. The number of bicycle riders is 'x2'. So the total income from inflating bicycle tires would be 2 * x1 * x2.\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings from inflating tricycle tires. Each tricycle has 3 tires and 'x1' cents is charged for inflating a single tire. The number of tricycle riders is 'x3'. So the total income from inflating tricycle tires would be 3 * x1 * x3.\n\nLastly, a unicycle has just a single tire, and one unicycle rider came in. So, the income from inflating the unicycle tire would be x1.\n\nAdding all the incomes, we get the total income in cents. Converting to dollars, we divide by 100, because 1 dollar = 100 cents.\n\nDoing all these calculations with the given values,\n\nBicycle income = 2 * 25 * 5 = 250 cents\nTricycle income = 3 * 25 * 3 = 225 cents\nUnicycle income = 25 cents\n\nTotal income = 250 + 225 + 25 = 500 cents \n\nIn dollars, it's 500/100 = $5.\n\nSo, the code block would look like:\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First calculate the earnings for bike, tricycle, and unicycle tires independently by multiplying the cost per tire by the number of tires and number of bikes/trikes/unicycles.
