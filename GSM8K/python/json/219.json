So half of Naomi's score is 68/2 = 34. Adding Yuri's 'x3' points to this gives 34+10 = 44 points.\n\nSecond, I'll find the points Brianna scored. As given she scored 'x4' points more than Naomi, this means she scored 68+17 = 85 points.\n\nTo find the number of points Jojo scored, I'll subtract the total points Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored from the total amount of points which are 'x1' points.
