As there are 6 packs, hence chicken costs $4 * 6 = $24 in total.\n\nNext, strawberry packs are priced at $4 each, hence $4 * 3 = $12 in total.\n\nLastly, each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is $4/2 = $2. As there are 7 packs, hence apples cost $2 * 7 = $14 in total.\n\nSo, the total cost spent on all the items is $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.\n\nSubtracting the total cost of items from the budget, we have $65 (budget) - $60 (cost) = $5 left with Kelly.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"The total cost of the bacon is $10.
