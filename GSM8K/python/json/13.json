If 's' represents Melanie's starting amount, we know that she sold a third at the green house, which is represented as s * 1/3. She sold an additional 'x1' amount at the red house, which would be s * 1/3 * x1 (which gives us s * 2/3 based on the provided 'x1' value). After that, she had half of what's left to sell at the orange house, so her ending amount 'x2' would equal what was left after the previous sales divided by 2. \n\nSetting up the equation, it would be x2 = ((s - (s * 1/3 + s * 2/3)) / 2\n\nGiven that 'x2' is 5, we can solve the equation for 's' which is the starting amount of vacuum cleaners.\n\n```json\n{ \n\"reason\": \"To find the starting amount, we firstly add up the sold amounts at the green and red houses, which yields 's'.
