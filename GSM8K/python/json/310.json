Find the total cost of the business suits: Multiply 'x1' by the cost of each business suit:\n   6 * $100 = $600 \n\n2. Find the total cost of the suitcases: Multiply 'x2' by the cost of each suitcase:\n   3 * $50 = $150 \n\n3. Find the cost of the flight ticket: Multiply 'x3' by the cost of each business suit and add $700:\n   (5 * $100) + $700 = $1200\n\n4. Sum the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:\n   $600 + $150 + $1200 =  $1950\n\n5. Subtract this sum from Theo's initial amount and deduct the amount he wishes to save to find the amount he has left to spend on gifts:\n   $6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $2050\n\nSo, Theo has $2050 to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.\n\nAnd in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"The total cost of business suits and suitcases was calculated by multiplying their individual costs by the number bought.
