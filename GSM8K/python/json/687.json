Therefore, their combined ages would be '2*age(Twin)' + '3*age(Triplet)' = 44. The age of the twin 'a' = 'x1' + the age of the triplet 'b'. From these information, we have two equations: 1) 2a + 3b = 44 and 2) a = b + x1. With 'x1' = 7, let's substitute equation 2 to equation 1, therefore we get: 2(b + 7) + 3b = 44. By solving this equation, we get the value of 'b' = 5.
