We are asked to find the difference in time taken by Ray to swim x3 miles when it's cold compared to when it's hot.\n\nHere, x1 = 16 represents the amount of time Ray takes to swim a mile when it's cold.\nOn a hot day, Ray takes 'x2' more minutes than twice the time he takes on a cold day per mile. This means, on a hot day, Ray takes (2*x1 + x2) minutes to swim a mile. So, it must be 2*16 + 2 = 34 minutes per mile on a hot day.\n\nGiven x3 = 3, we need to find the difference in time Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. \n\nSo, the increase in time for 3 miles would be '3*(Time taken on hot day - Time taken on cold day)', which results in 3*(34 - 16) = 54 minutes. \n\nSo, the time he takes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day is 54 minutes. \n\nBelow is the explanation in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we find the time taken by Ray to swim a mile on a hot day which is (2*x1 + x2) = (2*16 + 2) = 34 minutes.
