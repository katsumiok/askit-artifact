Let's say she uses x ounces of fragrance, x ounces of citrus zest, y ounces of salt, y ounces of sugar, and z ounces of oil. \n\nFrom the problem we know:\n\n1. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so x = x.\n2. The same amount of salt as sugar, so y = y.\n3. Twice as much oil as salt, so z = 2y.\n4. Twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2x.\n\nWe know that the total amount she makes equals 10 ounces, so:\n\nx (fragrance) + x (citrus zest) + y (salt) + y (sugar) + z (oil) = 10.\n\nSubstituting equivalent amounts we have:\n\nx + x + 2x + 2x + 2*2x = 10.\n8x = 10\nx (amount of fragrance and citrus zest) = 1.25 ounces\n\nSubstituting x in y = 2x, we get:\n\ny (amount of salt and sugar) = 2*1.25 = 2.5 ounces\n\nSubstituting y in z = 2y, we get:\n\nz (amount of oil) = 2*2.5 = 5 ounces.\n\nTanya uses 5 ounces of oil for the salt scrub.\n\nFinal answer is: \n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt.
