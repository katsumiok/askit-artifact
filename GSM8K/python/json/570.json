This means that Peter is willing to spend $70 / 7 days = $10 per day.\n\nFrom Sunday through Wednesday, Peter bought wooden action figures which cost $5 each. \n\nGiven that he allocates $10 per day and each wooden action figure costs $5, Peter could afford 10 / 5 = 2 wooden action figures a day. Since he bought such wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday (4 days), he got a total of 4 days * 2 action figures/day = 8 wooden action figures.\n\nThe rest of the week, which is Thursday through Saturday (3 days), Peter decided to spend his daily budget on plastic action figures that cost $2 each. Given that he is willing to spend $10 per day, he can afford 10 / 2 = 5 plastic action figures daily. In the remaining 3 days of the week, he would accumulate a total of 3 days * 5 action figures/day = 15 plastic action figures.\n\nBy adding up the two variable quantities (8 wooden and 15 plastic action figures), we will determine the total number of action figures Peter would have by the end of the week.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Peter has a weekly budget of $70 and wants to spend equally each day (7 days total), which means his daily budget is $10.
