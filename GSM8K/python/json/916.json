Since 'x1' = 1 and 'x2' = 2, this means they bought 1*2 = 2 balloons for $0.5 each, so this cost $0.5*2 = $1.\nNext, calculate the cost of the ice cream by multiplying 'x3' by $7. Since 'x3' = 2, this means they bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so this cost $7*2 = $14.\nAdd together the cost of the cake, the balloons, and the ice cream to find the total amount of money the girls spent. This was $11 (cake) + $1 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $26.\nFinally, divide the total amount by 2 to find the amount of allowance each girl received, since they both contributed equal amounts.
