Afterward, we can subtract the time she's already spent hiking to determine how much time she has left. Finally, we'll divide the distance remaining by this time to calculate her required hiking speed.\n\nHere is the calculation:\nFirst, find total time Marissa can take to finish 12 miles with an average speed of 'x3' (4 mph). This equals total distance over average speed -> 12/4 = 3 hours.\n\nNext, find out how much time she has already spent. We know she hiked for 'x1' (1) hour at first and then for another 1 hour, totaling -> 1 + 1 = 2 hours.\n\nSubtract this from the total time she has to finish the trail -> 3 - 2 = 1 hour. So, she has 1 hour to complete the remainder of the trail.\n\nFinally, subtract the distance she has already covered ('x2' 4 miles and the next 2 miles) from the total distance -> 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 miles.\n\nSo, Marissa needs to cover 6 miles in 1 hour, which means she needs to walk at 6 mph for the remaining distance.\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Marissa can spend a total of 3 hours hiking to average 4 mph over 12 miles.
