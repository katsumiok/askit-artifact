There are 12 inches in a foot, so we convert 8 feet to 96 inches. Therefore, total length of Topher's shoe in inches is 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that Topher's shoe length is 'x1' inches longer than 'x2' times the length of Bobby's shoes. We are given that 'x1' is 10 and 'x2' is 9, and we just calculated Topher's shoe length to be 100 inches.\n\nTherefore, we set up the following equation: 100 = 10 + 9 * Bobby's shoe length.\n\nSolving this equation for Bobby's shoe length gives us:\nBobby's shoe length = (100 - 10) / 9 = 90 / 9 = 10 inches\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"Three steps were involved in the calculation.
