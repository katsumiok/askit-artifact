To find out the number of pizzas, divide the cost of pizzas by the price of one pizza box. Let's compute:\n\n  Cost of one chicken meal = $12\n  Cost for milk packs = $3 * x1 = $3 * 5 = $15\n  Cost for apples = $1.50 * x2 = $1.50 * 4 = $6\n\nSo, the total cost of chicken meal, milk packs, and apples = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33\n\nThen, the cost of pizza boxes = $50 - $33 = $17\n\nFinally, the number of pizza boxes = $17 / $8.50 = 2\nLet's wrap this into a JSON response:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we calculated the total amount spent on the chicken meal, milk packs and apples.
