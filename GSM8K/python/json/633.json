If Tom is driving faster than Bob, he will eventually catch up.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n1. First, let's calculate the difference in speed between Tom and Bob. Given that Bob is driving at 55 mph and Tom is driving at 70 mph, the difference is 70 - 55 = 15 mph. This is how much faster Tom is driving compared to Bob.\n  \n2. The rat race scenario now translates directly into a simple time-distance problem. We divide the distance between Bob and Tom (75 miles) by the difference in their respective speeds (15 miles per hour). So the time it will take for Tom to catch Bob is 75/15 = 5 hours.\n\nApplying the above to the JSON format:\n\n```json\n{ \"reason\": \"First, we calculate the difference in speed between Tom and Bob (70 - 55 = 15 mph).
