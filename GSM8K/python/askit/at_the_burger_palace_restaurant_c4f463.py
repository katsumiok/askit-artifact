def at_the_burger_palace_restaurant_c4f463(x1) -> int:
    # Given the jar contains x1 jelly beans with the ratio of blue, red, and green as 1%, -1%, and 1% respectively
    # Set the blue jelly beans as the base (100%)
    # Then, red is 99% of blue and green is 101% of blue. 
    # Total jelly beans = blue + red + green = x1
    # Hence we have equation: blue + 0.99*blue + 1.01*blue = x1
    # Solving for blue, we get blue = x1 / 3
    blue = x1 / 3
    green = 1.01 * blue
    red = 0.99 * blue

    # The problem asks for the difference between green and red beans
    return abs(green - red)

# Note: This assumes that x1 is such that it can be evenly distributed into the given ratio
# If x1 does not fit exactly into the ratio, the returned value will not be an integer and 
# you might want to round, floor, or ceiling the result depending on context.
