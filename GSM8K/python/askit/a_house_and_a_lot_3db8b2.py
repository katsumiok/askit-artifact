def a_house_and_a_lot_3db8b2() -> int:
    # A house and a lot cost $120,000. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, how much did the house cost?
    
    # Let's denote the cost of the lot as 'x'. 
    # So the cost of the house will be '3x'.
    # According to the problem, the sum of the cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. 
    # So we have the equation: x + 3x = 120000 
    # Solving this equation will give us the cost of the house.
    
    # From the equation, 4x = 120000. Hence, x = 120000 / 4
    x = 120000 / 4
    
    # cost of the house is 3x
    house_cost = 3 * x
    
    return house_cost
