    # Considering the condition that Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room.
    # And Matt wants to eat five cookies in total
    # So, if we denote 'x' as the number of carrot sticks
    # then The equation will be 1/2x + 2 = 5
    # Solving this equation for x gives: x = 2(5 - 2) = 6
    return 6
