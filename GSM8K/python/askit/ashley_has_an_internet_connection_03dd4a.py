    # Ashley has an internet connection speed of 20kb per second. Knowing that'x1'Mb has'x2'kb, she wants to know her internet connection speed in Mb per hour. What is Ashleyâ€™s internet connection speed in Mb per hour?
    
    # First, convert the speed from kb/s to mb/s
    speed_in_mb_per_second = 20 / x2
    
    # Then, convert the speed to mb/hour. As there are 3600 seconds in 1 hour, multiply by this factor
    speed_in_mb_per_hour = speed_in_mb_per_second * 3600
