    # Four children are playing togetherâ€”Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, and the total age of the children is 20. If Akbar is'x1'years old and Alessandro is'x2'years old, calculate the age of Wilfred.

    # Calculate the total age of Akbar and Alessandro
    total_age_Akbar_Alessandro = x1 + x2

    # Since the total age of the children is 20 and Helene's age is twice the average,
