    # Jonathan was sad to learn he needed 'x1' more toys than he already had to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set, which had 'x2' toys. How many toys does Jonathan currently have?
    
    # Given that Jonathan needs x1 more toys to have a set 5 times larger than James's set of x2 toys, 
    # it means Jonathan currently has 5*x2 - x1 toys.
    return 5*x2 - x1
