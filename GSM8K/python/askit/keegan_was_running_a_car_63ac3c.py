    # Keegan was running a car wash with his friend Tashay to raise money for a baseball camp. They needed to raise $200 for the two of them. By'x1'pm, Keegan had earned $83 and Tasha had earned $91. How much more did they need to earn to reach their goal?
    earned = 83 + 91  # money earned by Keegan and Tasha
    goal = 200  # the total money they need to raise
    return goal - earned  # the amount they still need to earn
