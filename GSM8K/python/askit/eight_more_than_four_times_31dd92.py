    # Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40. How many coffee mugs are in the teacher’s lounge?
    
    # Let M be the number of mug
    # From the statement, we have: 4M + 8 = 40
    # We solve this equation to find M
    
    M = (40 - 8) / 4 # Solving equation
    
    return M
