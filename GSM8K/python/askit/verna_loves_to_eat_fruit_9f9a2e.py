    # Verna loves to eat fruit. She bought three apples at $1.50 each, five oranges at $0.80 each, and six peaches at $0.75 each.  If she gave $20, how much change did she receive?

    # calculate the total cost of the fruits
    total_cost = (3 * 1.5) + (5 * 0.8) + (6 * 0.75)

    # calculate the change she received
    change = 20 - total_cost

    # return the change
    return change
