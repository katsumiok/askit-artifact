    # Assume Lee has 's' sheep and 'g' geese.
    # A sheep has 4 legs and a goose has 2 legs. Also, a sheep and a goose both have 1 head. 
    # Therefore, 
    # 4s + 2g = 70 (total number of legs)
    # s + g = 20 (total number of heads)
    # By multiplying the second equation by 2, we get 2s + 2g = 40. Substracting it 
    # from the first equation, we get 4s - 2s = 70 - 40, 2s = 30.
    # So, the number of sheep ('s') is 30 / 2 = 15.
    sheep = 15
