One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds.  The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?","answer":2,"examples":[{"input":{"x1":4,"x2":400,"x3":400,"x4":400,"x5":55,"x6":400,"x7":60,"x8":3},"output":2}]}
