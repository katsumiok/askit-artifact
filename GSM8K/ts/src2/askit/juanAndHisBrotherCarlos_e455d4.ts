    // Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade. For each gallon they make it costs $3 for lemons 
    // and $2 for sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 'x1' glasses per gallon. 
    // If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend on lemons?
    
    // first, let's calculate how many gallons they made. 
    // we know their profit = total revenue - total cost. so total_revenue = total_cost + profit
    // total_revenue = cost_per_glass * glasses = 0.50 * x1 * number_of_gallons
    // we know total_cost = cost_of_lemons + cost_of_sugar = number_of_gallons * (3+2) = number_of_gallons * 5
    // so total_revenue = total_cost + profit = number_of_gallons * 5 + 25
    // from these, number_of_gallons = (total_revenue - 25) / 5 = (0.50 * x1 * number_of_gallons - 25) / 5
    // from this equation, we get number_of_gallons = 25 / ((0.50 * x1) - 5)
    let number_of_gallons = 25 / ((0.50 * x1) - 5);
    
    // then cost_of_lemons = number_of_gallons * cost_per_gallon where cost_per_gallon is $3
    let cost_of_lemons = number_of_gallons * 3;
