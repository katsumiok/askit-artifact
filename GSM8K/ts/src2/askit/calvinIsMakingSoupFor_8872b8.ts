    // He is an adult and will be eating with his adult wife and their two children. 
    // If everyone eats one bowl at a meal, how many times will each child be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup?

    // One pot has enough for four adults, or eight children.
    // Calvin and his wife will eat two adult portions, which equates to 4 child portions (because 1 adult portion = 2 child portions)
    // Then, they have two children who will also eat, consuming another 2 child portions. 
    // Therefore, after dinner, there will be 2 child portions left in the pot (8 total - 6 used = 2 left).

    // Since there are 2 child portions left over, and assuming each child eats one portion per meal, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch once more.
